<br><br><br><br>Classroom Activities
In order to foster a more optimal learning environment and ensure respect for all participants, the following policy is in effect during lectures, live-coding, and both guest and student presentations:<br>
- No personal electronic devices: Cell phones, tablets, laptops, and other devices must be turned off and put away unless explicitly permitted for note-taking or learning activity use.<br>
- No non-course-related activities: Gaming, video watching, social media use, or any other non-course-related activities are strictly prohibited.<br>
- Acceptable learning activities: Note-taking (electronic or handwritten) and productive doodling/drawing related to course content are permitted and encouraged.<br>
- Lab sessions: During hands-on lab portions, device use is allowed for course-related work, peer discussions, and instructor engagement.
<br>Affects Participation + Professionalism
Violations of this policy will impact the Participation and Professionalism grade. Multiple offenses may result in a zero (0) for this component of the course grade, without exception.
<br><br>Cheating and Plagiarism Definitions
Cheating or plagiarism, as defined for this course, are governed by the Drexel University Academic Integrity Policy.<br>
Both are strictly forbidden. DO NOT DO IT!<br>
All instances will be investigated and reported as outlined by Drexel University policy.<br>
They will also result in: at minimum failing the assignment and an automatic decrease&nbsp;of one letter grade for your final grade and may result in your failing the course.
<br><br>Submission Rules

<br>Submit all work via Drexel Learn (unless other wise specified).
<br>Follow assignment submission guidelines outlined in briefs
<br>Use proper file naming conventions (e.g., abc123_a1_lighting_final.mp4).

<br><br>Late Assignmnets
Assignments must be turned in on time!<br>
Lateness will automatically result in at&nbsp;minimum the loss of one letter grade.<br>
Late work incurs a 10% penalty per day.
<br><br>Attendance Requirements

<br>Attendance is mandatory. 
<br>Students are allowed one unexcused absence.
<br>Missing more than one class (unexcused) reduces your grade.
<br>Each late arrival to class will result in 50% attendance for the day.

<br>Excused Abcense
Note that an excused absence is defined as one that is the result of a condition or&nbsp;circumstance beyond the student's control, such as illness, a family crisis or&nbsp;emergency, or some other serious and important personal circumstance.
<br>Three or more absences results in course failure.<br><br>AI Use Policy
Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as large language models (e.g., ChatGPT or Claude), may be used in this course under specific guidelines, outlined below.
<br>Approved AI Uses

<br>AI tools are permitted for developing assets for assignments and projects, such as generating images or code snippets.
<br>Students may use AI to help better contextualize and understand code, programming concepts, and course structures. This includes using AI for code review, breakdowns, and topic summaries.
<br>All written materials, explanations, and analyses submitted for assignments should be the original work of the student. AI should not be used to generate these portions of your submissions.

<br>Use and Citation
The use of AI tools is not mandatory. Students may opt out of using AI assistants entirely if they prefer to complete all work without AI assistance.<br>
When AI tools are used, students must clearly indicate which portions of their work were created with AI assistance and which tools were used.
<br>Use and Understanding
Regardless of AI usage, students are responsible for understanding and being able to explain all aspects of their submitted work.
<br><br>Course Changes to the Course
It is very important that each student has read and understood all the materials,&nbsp;assignments, and due dates on the syllabus. It is the prerogative of the instructor to change the course during the term at their discretion in the interest of&nbsp;responding to individual class needs. Changes will be communicated to students via Drexel Learn and/or email
<br><br><br>This course, including all meetings, assignments, and activities, operates under Drexel University‚Äôs policies. All students are expected to read and fully understand these policies as they apply to the coursework and conduct within this class.<br><br>Plagiarism and Cheating Policy

<br>Plagiarism or cheating will result in a failing grade for the assignment and potential course failure and further academic discipline.
