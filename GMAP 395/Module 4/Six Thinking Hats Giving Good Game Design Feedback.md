# 🎩 Six Thinking Hats: Giving Good Game Design Feedback

The **Six Thinking Hats** method helps provide **structured and meaningful feedback**. Instead of just saying, _“I like this”_ or _“This part is bad”_, this method encourages you to **analyze different aspects of the project** from multiple perspectives.

Each hat represents a **different way of thinking** about a certain topic/idea, even about your own or another's game! You don’t need to use every hat in every response, but using **at least three** will make your feedback more valuable.

---

## ⚪ **White Hat: Facts & Information**

> 🧐 _What are the objective facts about the project?_

- What engine and tools are being used?
- What mechanics or interactions are already implemented?
- What is the current progress based on the assignment requirements?

✅ **Example:**  
_"This project is using Unity with Shader Graph for post-processing effects. The main interaction involves triggering particle effects when the player approaches the artifact."_

---

## 🔴 **Red Hat: Feelings & Emotions**

> ❤️ _What is your emotional reaction?_

- How does the game or visual style **make you feel**?
- Does the atmosphere match the intended theme?
- Is there a sense of excitement, mystery, or immersion?

✅ **Example:**  
_"The eerie glow of the procedural artifact really sells the ‘Something from the Void’ theme! The lighting gives it a mysterious, almost supernatural feel."_

---

## ⚫ **Black Hat: Problems & Weaknesses**

> ⚠️ _What could be improved?_

- What **isn’t working well yet**?
- Are there **technical issues** (glitches, lighting problems, unclear mechanics)?
- Does anything feel **unfinished or confusing**?

✅ **Example:**  
_"The portal shader effect is cool, but the animation is a bit too fast. Slowing it down might make it feel more mystical."_

---

## 🟡 **Yellow Hat: Strengths & Positives**

> 🌟 _What is working well?_

- What parts of the project **stand out** as strong design choices?
- What **mechanics, visuals, or interactions** are impressive?
- Does anything feel **polished or well-executed**?

✅ **Example:**  
_"The camera effects are really well done! The depth of field gives a cinematic quality when approaching the artifact."_

---

## 🟢 **Green Hat: Creativity & Ideas**

> 💡 _What creative suggestions can you offer?_

- How could the project be **expanded or enhanced**?
- Are there **cool ideas** that might fit well with what’s already there?
- What **additional effects, interactions, or mechanics** could improve the experience?

✅ **Example:**  
_"Since your artifact pulses when approached, maybe add an ambient sound effect that gets louder as players get closer?"_

---

## 🔵 **Blue Hat: Organization & Next Steps**

> 📌 _What should be done next?_

- What is the **biggest priority** for improvement?
- Are there missing elements that need to be added?
- What should the creator focus on before the next milestone?

✅ **Example:**  
_"The next step could be refining the lighting and adjusting the post-processing settings. Maybe add a slight vignette effect to enhance the void-like atmosphere?"_

## 📝 **How to Use This Method for Peer Feedback**

When giving feedback, **use at least three hats** to provide a balanced response. Example structure:

```markdown
Feedback for [Student's Project Name]

What’s working well? 
- The glowing edges on the artifact are really effective at drawing attention.  

What could be improved?  
- The shader animation is a bit too fast; slowing it down might add more mystery.  

Creative suggestion:  
- What if you added a slight distortion effect around the artifact, like it’s warping space around it?  
```

**Remember:** Your feedback should be **specific and constructive**—help your peers refine their projects!
