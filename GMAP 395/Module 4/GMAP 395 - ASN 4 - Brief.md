# Assignment 4: Cinemachine and Post-Processing Integration

## Overview

> [!info] Assignment Overview  
> In this final module assignment, students will:
> 
> 1. Integrate **at least two (2)** post-processing effects into their project using Unity's URP Post-Processing system.
> 2. Control **one post-processing effect dynamically** through C# scripting (such as adjusting bloom intensity, vignette strength, or depth of field focus).
> 3. Present their work within their ongoing project scene and document the process in a README file.

---

## Assignment Brief

> [!summary] Assignment Breakdown
> 
> - **Part 1: Post-Processing Effects**
>     - Apply a minimum of **two (2)** post-processing effects (examples: Bloom, Depth of Field, Color Adjustments, Vignette, Chromatic Aberration).
>     - Ensure these effects contribute to the overall atmosphere and mood of your environment.
> - **Part 2: Scripted Post-Processing Control**
>     - Write a **C# script** to dynamically adjust at least **one** of your post-processing parameters during runtime (e.g., change vignette intensity when the player approaches the artifact).

---

## Deliverables

> [!todo] What to Submit
> 
1.**README File** (Markdown or TXT) that explains:
>     - Which post-processing effects you used and why.
>     - How your C# script controls a post-processing effect in real-time.
>     - Any challenges you faced and how you resolved them.
> 2. **Recorded Video (5â€“10 Minutes)**:
>     - Screen-record your scene.
>     - Walk through the post-processing effects, scripted control, and Cinemachine setup.
>     - Reflect on how these elements contribute to the overall polish of your environment.

## Example README Format

```
# Assignment 4: Cinemachine and Post-Processing Integration

## Post-Processing Effects
- Bloom: Applied to enhance artifact glow.
- Depth of Field: Used to focus attention on the artifact when nearby.
- Vignette: Added subtle dark edges for atmospheric tension.

## Scripted Control
- I created a script that increases vignette intensity as the player gets closer to the artifact, creating a sense of pressure and immersion.

## Challenges
- Ensuring smooth transitions between Cinemachine cameras.
- Managing post-processing volume blending across different zones.
