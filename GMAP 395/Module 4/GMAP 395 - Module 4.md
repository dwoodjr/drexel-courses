# Module 4 – Camera Effects and Post-Processing

## Overview

In this module, you'll learn how to enhance your game environments using advanced camera systems and post-processing techniques. These tools allow you to craft cinematic experiences, dynamic gameplay feedback, and a polished visual style that responds to player actions.

---

## Topics Covered
- **Full-Screen Effects and Post-Processing:**
    - Bloom, depth of field, color grading, vignette, and more using Unity’s Post-Processing stack.
    - Creating mood and atmosphere through visual filtering.
- **Modular Camera Systems:**
    - Cinemachine for dynamic, reusable camera rigs.
    - Triggered camera transitions and guided player focus.
- **Camera Effects and Real-Time Feedback:**
    - Screen shake, zooms, and motion blur tied to gameplay events.
    - Using camera motion and effects to reinforce player actions.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will:

- Implement a modular camera system using Cinemachine.
- Apply post-processing profiles to enhance scene visuals.
- Trigger real-time camera effects based on player interactions.
- Understand the connection between camera design and player experience.

---

## Preparation

- Ensure your Unity project is using the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**.
- Install **Cinemachine** via the Unity Package Manager.
- Review your previous modules to integrate existing assets and shaders into a cohesive scene.
