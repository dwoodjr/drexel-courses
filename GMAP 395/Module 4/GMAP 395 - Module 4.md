## Topics Covered

- Understanding **post-processing effects** and how they enhance visual storytelling and atmosphere.
- Creating **dynamic camera systems** with **Unity's Cinemachine** package.
- **Advanced camera techniques** including camera shake, follow systems, and cinematic transitions.
- Developing **post-processing profiles** for consistent visual language and mood.
- **Integrating camera effects** into gameplay systems and player feedback loops.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand how **post-processing and camera systems** contribute to **game feel** and player immersion.
- Create basic to advanced post-processing effects using **Unity's URP Volume system**.
- Implement **responsive camera systems** that react to player actions and game state.
- Develop **consistent visual atmosphere** through post-processing profiles.
- **Integrate camera effects** into complete gameplay systems for professional polish.

---

## Preparation

- Ensure your Unity project is using the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**.
- Install **Cinemachine** via the Unity Package Manager.
- Review your previous modules to integrate existing assets and effects into a cohesive scene.

> [!warning] URP Requirement Post-processing in this module requires **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)** or **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)**. It will NOT work with Built-in Render Pipeline.

> [!warning] If you have never used Cinemachine
