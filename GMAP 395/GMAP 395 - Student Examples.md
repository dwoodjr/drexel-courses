[!note]
> For this particular run of the course, students were tasked with creating something more aligned with an MVP for a game concept (more full game like) with a gameplay loop, rules, assets, and interactivity. The course does *not* require the full gameplay loop or rules now. It is much more art and tech integration focused.
