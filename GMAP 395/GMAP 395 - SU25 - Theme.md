# Course Theme: So What About Tomorrow?

> [!abstract] Theme Overview **So What About Tomorrow?** is an open-ended exploration of temporal concepts, technological evolution, and speculative futures. 
> This theme invites students to consider relationships between past, present, and future through their art and technical work. 
> 
> Rather than prescriptive guidelines, this framework offers creative starting points that can be interpreted broadly across many visual styles and conceptual approaches.

## Theme Interpretation

### Core Question
**"So What About Tomorrow?"** can be approached from multiple angles:
- How does technology evolve and change over time?
- What stories do objects tell about their past and potential futures?
- How do we visualize concepts of progress, decay, hope, or uncertainty?
- What aesthetic choices communicate temporal relationships?

### Flexible Creative Directions
Students may explore any aspect of "tomorrow" that interests them:

- **Technological Speculation**: Future tools, interfaces, or environments
- **Temporal Archaeology**: Past technologies reimagined or rediscovered
- **Evolution and Change**: Transformation processes over time
- **Utopian/Dystopian Visions**: Optimistic or cautionary futures
- **Cyclical Time**: Recurring patterns or circular progression
- **Personal Tomorrow**: Individual hopes, fears, or expectations

## Suggested Visual Approaches

> [!note] Visual Suggestions (Not Requirements) These are starting points for inspiration - students are encouraged to develop their own visual language that serves their interpretation of the theme.

### Example Aesthetic Direction: "Echoes of Tomorrow"

_One possible interpretation focusing on technological archaeology_

#### Color Palette Suggestions


- **Primary Colors**: Deep blues (#0A1628), steel grays (#2C3E50), charcoal blacks (#1C1C1C)
```palette
#0A1628, #2C3E50, #1C1C1C; 
```
- **Accent Colors**: Electric cyan (#00D4FF), plasma purple (#8A2BE2), warning amber (#FF8C00)
```palette
#00D4FF, #8A2BE2, #FF8C00; 
```
- **Organic Elements**: Copper patina (#B87333), moss green (#228B22), rust orange (#CC5500)
```palette
#B87333, #228B22, #CC5500
```

#### Material Exploration Ideas

- **Temporal Layering**: Showing multiple time periods in one object
- **Wear and Evolution**: How materials change and age over time
- **Synthetic vs. Organic**: Contrasting artificial and natural elements
- **Information as Physical**: Data visualization made tangible

#### Lighting Concepts

- **Contrast**: Sharp differences between old and new elements
- **Revelation**: Lighting that discovers or uncovers hidden details
- **Atmosphere**: Environmental mood that suggests time passage
- **Focus**: Directing attention to key temporal relationships

## Technical Skill Integration

### Building Your Interactive Scene

**Core Question**: How can "So What About Tomorrow?" guide the creation of a cohesive, interactive game art experience?

### Module 1: Procedural Modeling + Lighting Systems

**Scene Foundation**: How do we create modular systems that tell temporal stories?

- **Procedural Systems**: What rules can generate assets that show change or evolution over time?
- **Modular Architecture**: How can components be recombined to suggest different temporal states?
- **Dynamic Lighting**: What lighting changes could represent the passage of time or reveal hidden temporal layers?
- **Environmental Storytelling**: How do procedural elements and lighting work together to communicate your vision of "tomorrow"?

### Module 2: Shaders and Materials Development

**Surface Narratives**: How do materials express temporal concepts through interaction?

- **Dynamic Shaders**: What material properties change to show time, use, or environmental response?
- **Interactive Materials**: How do surfaces respond to player interaction to reveal temporal stories?
- **Visual Consistency**: How do custom shaders maintain your interpretation of the theme across different objects?
- **Performance Integration**: How do shader effects enhance the scene without breaking real-time performance?

### Module 3: Effects and Particles

**Atmospheric Storytelling**: How do effects systems bring temporal concepts to life?

- **Environmental Integration**: What particle systems enhance your scene's temporal atmosphere?
- **Reactive Systems**: How do effects respond to player interaction or environmental changes?
- **Modular Effects**: How can particle systems be reused and recombined for efficiency?
- **Narrative Support**: How do effects reinforce your interpretation of "tomorrow" without overwhelming the scene?

### Module 4: Camera and Post-Processing

**Experiential Presentation**: How do camera systems guide the player through your temporal narrative?

- **Dynamic Perspective**: What camera movements or transitions reveal different aspects of your "tomorrow"?
- **Interactive Focus**: How does the camera system respond to player interaction to highlight temporal elements?
- **Post-Processing Integration**: How do visual effects enhance the mood and readability of your temporal concept?
- **Cohesive Experience**: How do camera and post-processing unify all other technical elements into a single vision?

### Cross-Module Integration Questions

**Scene Cohesion**: How do all technical elements work together to create a unified interactive experience?

- **Theme Unity**: How do procedural assets, shaders, effects, and camera work together to express your vision of "tomorrow"?
- **Interactive Flow**: How does player interaction reveal different aspects of your temporal concept across all systems?
- **Technical Harmony**: How do performance considerations influence creative decisions while maintaining thematic integrity?
- **Portfolio Presentation**: How does your final scene demonstrate both technical competency and personal artistic vision?
