# Assignment 2: Dynamic Shaders and Materials

## Overview

> [!info] Assignment Overview  
> In this assignment, students will:
> 
> 1. Develop custom shaders and materials for the procedural game asset created in ***Assignment 1***.
> 2. Use Unity's Shader Graph or a similar node-based tool to create dynamic, real-time effects (must be displayed in Unity).
> 3. Ensure shaders and materials enhance the asset’s presentation, aligning with the class theme: _Something from the Void_.
> 4. Present the final shaders in a Unity scene and document the process in a README file.

## Assignment Brief

> [!summary] Assignment Breakdown
> 
> - **Part 1: Shader Creation**  
>     Design and implement dynamic shaders to achieve real-time visual effects for your asset.
> - **Part 2: Interactive Material Application**  
>     Use the shaders and materials from `Part 1`, to create a real-time feedback based on a game event.

## Assignment Details

### Theme: Something from the Void

> [!question] Shader Inspiration from the Void  
> Explore the theme by crafting shaders and materials that evoke mystery, emptiness, or cosmic energy. Examples include:
> - A swirling galaxy effect on a portal or artifact.
> - A glowing material with pulsating patterns and emissive highlights.
> - Transparency effects to mimic glass-like or ethereal surfaces.

### Part 1: Shader Creation

> [!note] Key Steps for Part 1
> 
> 1. Use **Unity Shader Graph** or a compatible node-based shader tool.
> 2. Develop shaders that include at least two of the following techniques:
>     - **Transparency or Opacity Masks:** Create layered effects or partial visibility.
>     - **Emissive Effects:** Add glowing patterns or highlights.
>     - **Procedural Textures:** Use noise or gradients for dynamic surface details.
>     - **Animation:** Introduce movement, such as shifting patterns or pulsating effects.
> 3. Apply the shaders to your procedural asset from Assignment 1.
> 4. Test the shaders in Unity to ensure real-time performance.

### Part 2: Material Application

> [!note] Key Steps for Part 2
> 
> 1. Use exposed shader parameters and C# in Unity to created real-time feedback.
> 2. Further develop your shaders and materials for:
> 	- **Game-based Interaction:** React to lighting, proximity, or player actions.
> 3. Adjust material properties for optimal presentation:
>     - Set parameters for color, intensity, transparency, and more.
> 4. Design the Unity scene to showcase the material effects:
>     - Add secondary lights, adjust post-processing (bloom), and environmental elements for context.

> [!tip] Shader Design Tips
> 
> - Use **color theory** and emissive settings to emphasize the void theme.
> - Combine **procedural noise** and gradient ramps to create abstract patterns.
> - Test your shaders with different lighting conditions to ensure versatility.

## Deliverables

> [!todo] What to Submit
>1. README File:
>     - A Markdown, TXT, or PDF file that explains your work:
>         - Shader design techniques and inspirations.
>         - Material setup and Unity scene configuration.
>         - Challenges encountered and solutions implemented.
> 2. Recorded Video (5–10 Minutes):
>     - A ***Screen Recorded*** video walkthrough showcasing:
>         - Record the Unity Scene and any other relevant DDC application used
>         - Shader effects and how they align with the theme.
>         - Material application in Unity and real-time demonstration of effects.
>         - Integration of lights and post-processing(optional) to complement the shaders.

> [!warning] Screenrecording
> Download *OBS Studio* or some other comparable software, record your screen and talk me through your design process and other requirements specified in the document.
