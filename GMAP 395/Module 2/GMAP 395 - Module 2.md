# Module 2 - Shaders and Material Development

## Overview

This module deals with **shader creation** and **material development**, essential skills for adding dynamic visual behavior to assets. Students will explore both code-based and node-based shader workflows, focusing on enhancing procedural assets for real-time interactivity.
