# Assignment 1: Procedural Game Art and Lighting Systems

## Overview

> [!info] Assignment Overview  
> In this assignment, students will:
> 
> 1. Create a procedural game asset in a DCC tool of their choice (e.g., Blender, Houdini, Unity).
> 2. Import this asset into Unity to design and implement a lighting system that complements the asset's visual and thematic qualities.
> 3. Ensure the asset and lighting align with the class theme: _Something from the Void_.
> 4. Present their work as a Unity scene with a README file documenting their process and a recorded video explaining their approach.

## Assignment Brief

> [!summary] Assignment Breakdown
> 
> - **Part 1: Procedural Game Art ** 
>     Create a procedural asset using a DCC software like Blender or Houdini. The asset must reflect the artistic theme _Something from the Void_. 
> 	    Examples include eerie cosmic objects, Lovecraftian architecture, or mysterious artifacts.
>     
> - **Part 2: Lighting Systems in Unity ** 
>     Import the procedural asset into Unity, set up a lighting system that complements the theme and enhances its presentation, and apply optional post-processing effects.
>

## Assignment Details

### Theme: Something from the Void

> [!question] How to Approach the Theme  
> The theme _Something from the Void_ is intentionally open-ended. Interpret it creatively—examples include:
> 
> - Cosmic and Space-Inspired: Black holes, celestial ruins, or futuristic alien artifacts.
> - Horror or Mystery: Dark, surreal environments or Lovecraftian designs.
> - Abstract Concepts: Geometry and lighting that evoke emptiness, infinity, or the unknown.

### Part 1: Procedural Game Art

> [!note] Key Steps for Part 1
> 
> 1. Choose a DCC software like Blender, Houdini, or Maya.
> 	1. The tutorial for part 1 of this module uses Blender Geometry Nodes
> 2. Use procedural techniques/operations and a node-based workflow to create or modify a game art asset.
> 3. Ensure the asset embodies the class theme.
> 4. Export the asset to a format suitable for Unity (e.g., `.fbx`, `.obj`).

> [!example] Example Ideas for Procedural Assets
> 
> - A glowing, alien crystal pulsing with energy.
> - Ruined architecture on a distant moon.
> - A swirling void orb or portal structure.

### Part 2: Lighting Systems in Unity

> [!note] Key Steps for Part 2
> 
> 1. Import your procedural asset into Unity.
> 2. Set up a lighting system that complements the theme and highlights your asset:
>     - Use at least one directional light to simulate natural or artificial light.
>     - Add secondary lights (spotlights, area lights, etc.) for mood and detail.
> 3. Design the scene to enhance the asset’s presentation within the theme.

> [!tip] Lighting Design Tips
> 
> - Think about how lighting enhances the void-related theme (e.g., shadows, stark contrasts, or mysterious glows).
> - Experiment with unusual light colors and intensities to evoke an otherworldly atmosphere.

## Deliverables

> [!todo] What to Submit
> 
> 1. Procedural Asset Source File:
>     - Upload your DCC project file (e.g., `.blend`, `.hip`, `.mb`) to show procedural workflows.
> 2. README File:
>     - Create a `README` file in TXT or Markdown format that explains your work.
>     - Include:
>         - A description of your procedural asset and its thematic inspiration.
>         - Details of your lighting setup in Unity.
>         - Any challenges you faced and how you solved them.
> 3. Recorded Video (5–10 Minutes):
>     - Record a video that breaks down your design process.
>     - The video must cover:
>         - Procedural Operations: Explain how you created your procedural game asset.
>         - Lighting Setup: Discuss your lighting choices in Unity, including tools and techniques used.
>         - Theme Alignment: Reflect on how your work ties into _Something from the Void_.

> # Assignment 1: Procedural Game Art and Lighting Systems
> 
> ## Procedural Asset
> - Software Used: Blender  
> - Description: A modular crystal formation inspired by black holes, procedurally generated using Geometry Nodes.
> 
> ## Unity Lighting Setup
> - Lighting Design: Directional light for a natural glow, spotlights for eerie highlights.  
> - Post-Processing: Enabled bloom and vignette for a mystical, void-like effect.
> 
> ## Challenges
> - Issue: Balancing the asset’s high-detail geometry for real-time performance.  
> - Solution: Reduced polygon count and baked high-resolution normals.  
> ```
