## 🤖 What Are Procedural Workflows?

**Procedural workflows** use algorithms and rules to automate content creation, enabling developers to generate vast amounts of varied content efficiently. This is often refered to as Procedural Content Generation of *PCG*.

### 🔄 The Procedural Paradigm Shift

**Traditional Approach:** _"I need to model 50 unique trees manually"_ 
**Procedural Approach:** _"I need to create rules that generate 50 unique trees automatically"_

> [!tip] 💡 **Core Principle** Write the rules once, generate infinite variations.

## 🎯 Why Procedural Workflows Matter

### ⚡ **Efficiency Benefits**
- **Reduces repetitive tasks** - Focus on creative rules rather than manual labor
- **Accelerates iteration** - Adjust parameters instead of rebuilding assets
- **Eliminates manual errors** - Consistent application of rules

### 📈 **Scalability Advantages**
- **Enables vast worlds** - Generate content beyond manual capabilities
- **Supports rapid prototyping** - Test multiple design directions quickly
- **Facilitates easy updates** - Modify rules to update entire asset libraries

### 🎨 **Creative Enhancement**
- **Generates unexpected results** - Algorithmic serendipity sparks creativity
- **Provides systematic exploration** - Methodically explore design possibilities
- **Maintains consistency** - Unified rules ensure cohesive and consistence aesthetics (with parameters providing variability when needed)

## 📊 Taxonomy of Procedural Content Generation

The terms and definitions for the "taxonomy of PCG" were originally provided by a paper [Procedural Content Generation for Games: A Survey](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://atlarge-research.com/pdfs/2013-hendrikx-procedural.pdf). These terms are very useful for understanding the various levels of components for PCG and their breakdown within video games. 

### 🧩 **Game Bits**

- **Assets:** Textures, sounds, models
- **Components:** Individual game elements

### 🗺️ **Game Space**

- **Levels:** Playable areas and environments
- **Terrains:** Landscapes and geographical features
- **Maps:** Layout and spatial organization

### ⚙️ **Game Systems**

- **Rules:** Mechanical relationships and interactions
- **Mechanics:** Gameplay systems and features

### 📖 **Game Scenarios**

- **Events:** Dynamic occurrences and triggers
- **Narratives:** Story elements and branching paths
- **Quests:** Mission and objective generation

## 🔧 Procedural vs. Manual: Strategic Decision Making

### ✅ **Use Procedural When:**

- Creating many similar but varied elements
- Needing rapid iteration on design parameters
- Working with systematic, rule-based patterns
- Building scalable content pipelines

### ✋ **Use Manual When:**

- Creating hero assets (see note below) requiring precise artistic control
- Working with unique, one-off designs
- Dealing with highly irregular or organic forms
- Fine-tuning specific aesthetic details

> [!NOTE] On "Hero Assets"
    > There are many instances where a hero asset can be partially or fully procedurally generated. It depends on the game and the context fo the game experience.

### 🤝 **Hybrid Approach (Most Common)**

> [!success] **Best Practice Workflow**
> 
> 1. **Generate** base content procedurally
> 2. **Manually adjust** and refine key elements
> 3. **Use procedural methods** for variations and iterations

## 🛠️ Common Procedural Operations


### 🎲 **Core Techniques**

**Scattering/Distribution:**

- Random placement with controlled variation
- Density maps for placement frequency
- Collision avoidance systems

**Parameter Manipulation:**

- Randomization within specified ranges
- Mathematical relationships between properties
