## 💡 What is Game Lighting?

**Game lighting** balances artistic vision with technical constraints to create immersive, performant visual experiences.

### 🎯 **Core Purposes**

1. **🎭 Enhance mood and atmosphere** - Emotional storytelling through light
2. **👀 Guide player attention** - Direct focus to important elements
3. **🔍 Improve visual clarity** - Ensure gameplay readability
4. **📢 Communicate mechanics** - Light as gameplay information
5. **⚡ Balance aesthetics with performance** - Maintain target frame rates

## 🔧 Key Lighting Attributes

### 🎨 **Quality, Quantity, Direction**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7MNl-j7WqTw?si=DfxcntQvlkXxpBhY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Quality:**

- How light interacts with surfaces
- Shadow softness and light falloff
- Surface material response

**Quantity:**

- Light intensity and coverage
- Brightness levels appropriate to scene
- Balance preventing visual fatigue

**Direction:**

- Light angle and position
- Dramatic silhouetting effects
- Texture and form enhancement

## 🌟 Types of Lighting Systems

### ⚡ **Direct vs. Indirect Lighting**

**Direct Lighting:**

- Light hits surfaces directly from source
- Fast, predictable rendering
- Limited realism without bounces

**Indirect Lighting:**

- Light bounces off surfaces before reaching viewer
- Creates realistic ambient illumination
- More computationally expensive

### 🌍 **Global Illumination (GI)**

**Simulates realistic light interactions:**

- Light bouncing between surfaces
- Color bleeding from colored surfaces
- Realistic ambient lighting

## 🔦 Light Source Types

### 📍 **Common Light Objects** (variations of these are found in many DCCs)

**Directional Light:**

- Simulates sunlight with infinite reach
- Parallel rays across entire scene
- Efficient for outdoor environments

**Point Light:**

- Emits uniformly in all directions
- Ideal for bulbs, fires, magical effects
- Falloff creates natural attenuation

**Spot Light:**

- Cone-shaped beam with defined angle
- Perfect for flashlights, stage lighting
- Controllable cone angle and edge softness

**Area Light:**

- Illuminates from surface rather than point
- Soft, realistic shadows
- Usually baked-only due to performance cost

## ⚙️ Light Modes and Performance

### 🔧 **Rendering Approaches**

**Dynamic Lighting:**

- Updates continuously during gameplay
- Interactive with moving objects
- Higher performance cost

**Static/Baked Lighting:**

- Pre-calculated for non-moving elements
- Stored in lightmaps and textures
- Optimal performance for static geometry

**Mixed Lighting:**

- Combines dynamic and static methods
- Static lighting with dynamic shadows
- Best balance of quality and performance

## 📊 Optimization Strategies

### ⚡ **Performance Best Practices**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXggMZvqSvM?si=_8we5-icTZw7dV3Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

1. **🎯 Limit Realtime Lights**
    
    - Use baked lighting wherever possible
    - Reserve dynamic lights for key gameplay elements
2. **🔀 Leverage Mixed Lighting**
    
    - Combine baked GI with dynamic shadows
    - Best quality-to-performance ratio
3. **📍 Light Probes**
    
    - Optimize lighting for dynamic objects
    - Sample baked lighting at key positions
4. **🪞 Reflection Probes**
    
    - Simulate realistic reflections efficiently
    - Baked cubemaps for static reflections
5. **📈 Profile Regularly**
    
    - Monitor lighting performance impact
    - Identify bottlenecks early
