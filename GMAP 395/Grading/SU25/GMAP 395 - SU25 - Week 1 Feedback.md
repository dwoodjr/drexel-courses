### From Student:
“So what About Tomorrow?” = Nuclear Fallout from War For this project, I want to capture the most pregnant manifestation of this theme by depicting a near-future scenario where humanity’s on the brink of extinction set in a haunting, post-detonation environment. The player will navigate the procedurally generations remains of a town destroyed by a nuclear missile, investigating what’s left behind, destroyed buildings, charred remains of objects, whilst missiles are still flying and detonating overhead in the horizon.  This essentially forces the player to question: Is there even a tomorrow left for us? AMBITIOUS LEVEL: VERY 

### Notes:
- Check out some info the VR Documentary project "On The Morning You Wake (To the End of the World)": https://www.onthemorningyouwake.com/. It has some similar tone and themes to what you are exploring, at a more current cultural memory and touchstone. Their visually style of using volumetric video and point clouds is also really interesting for them theme/tone. 
- I think you will likely need to scale back some. Start simple with the asset(s) you want to develop and then fill out the rest of the space will sourced assets. You can always go back later and fill in with your own work and tweak things visually and mechanically.
- The logic you are working with with your early procedural modeling tests works well, and you seem to have found some good info/sources on how to achieve that destruction look. 

### Final Feedback:
Your procedural destruction logic is solid and you've found good technical resources for achieving that devastation aesthetic. The thematic concept is compelling and timely.
The scope is extremely ambitious for this project timeline. You'll likely need to scale back some. Start simple with the asset(s) you want to develop and then fill out the rest of the space with sourced assets. You can always go back later and fill in with your own work and tweak things visually and mechanically.

The core concept has real impact potential - just needs strategic scoping to execute effectively within our timeframe.

With the theme of “So What About Tomorrow”, I first thought about what the world would look like without humans in the future. What would places that are usually packed with people look without people there to take up the space? How would these huge corporations that look all powerful to us now look in ruins? I would make a fast food restaurant look decayed and overtaken with plants. However, I wouldn’t be aiming for the piece to look sad, or depressing. Rather, I’d want it to look at peace being back with nature, similar to the feeling in the Love, Death, and Robots episode “Three Robots”. 
Moss and small plants 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Start with a base model/scene Create points on the models/scene where plants can grow on Rule: 80% chance a point will grow plants Chose one of three models (Moss, and 2 Plant types) Rule: If the player moves towards the horizon, the plants grow in size. If the player moves away from the horizon, the plants will shrink

### Notes
- From what I understood about your project idea yo would like to do an interior with some foliage/overgrowth to connect with the theme. I think this is an excellent idea, and you have really two opportunities for some procedural modeling or procedural systems techniques; the building interior and the plants. But from what I gathered you are more interested in the foliage/plants; which is great!
- There are several approaches to going plants and moss. Moss would likely be more a texture workflow on top of UVs. The other plants like fines and overgrowth have more direct modeling potential. Here are some sources that should serve well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0MD_pB7LQ0 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uslTaqiv_7k
- The main ideas/concepts for most plants and some form of curves system for stems or branches 9maybe L-systems for trees/shrubs) and then having leaf geometry scattered onto edges/loops/points. I would start there.
- I think the scope is good here, especially if you use some sourced assets or simple form (to get started) with the interior you want to grow plants on. Take a look at thing one: https://80.lv/articles/craft-realistic-vines-with-this-free-blender-s-geometry-nodes-tutorial

Project Concept Initial Vision My initial vision is to create a procedural generated scene using modular assets. The scene will be a dark, underground tunnel system that eventually leads to the outside world. Within the tunnel system will be a centipede-like monster that roams through the tunnels either to get you or block your path. Scope I believe in my ability to program such a project, especially through the use of modular and procedural techniques. While I am not making a game for this project, I still wanted to create a scene that would work within the context of a game. This may be ambitious of a project, but I am interested in the field of technical art and want to push myself.
Logic Flow Visualization Procedural Tilemap Level Given a tilemap input, the level should generate a level that matches the layout of the input using corresponding modular environment blocks. I essentially envision this project’s final product to be a functional level editor with playtesting functionality. Example Level Layout 01 02 03 0

### Notes
- This is a great interpretation of the theme and I think you project idea has the potential to work well to bring that to life.
- I think some clarification is needed on how you envision the interacting and generation working. Are you working to have a full level generated? As you mentioned, you need to be focused on the tunnel made with procedurally places assets. I would maybe start there, instead of trying for a full level at fist. I can see an opportunity to have the player define the spline/path (maybe with a tile map) that the tunnel will take and then having it generate after a "confirmation."
- It seems your project is more interested/suited for developing the spawning system (more on the Unity side) rather than on the modeling side, which is perfectly fine! So feel free to start with some very simple primitives or sourced assets for the scattering.
- Have a look at some spline-based generation in Unity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYmudT12NcI and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiHH_BvjoGk.

My goal for this project is to create a world overrun by water, and thus, pirates. I want to create a scene of a pirate ship on water, with evidence of modern society scattered around the vast ocean. The pirate ship would be an amalgamation of what traditionally we imagine when we think pirate, with modern/futuristic elements. I want to not only invoke a feeling of familiarity by including assets stereotypical to a pirate ship, but also bring awareness to what might happen if we continue to ignore the rising sea levels. I want the pirate ship to feel very lived in, like the crew has nowhere else to go. They are all stuck on this ship. There would be lots of irreversible water damage. Start with: the pirate ship scene. 2. Add: mark potential places where there would be damage (around the edges, on the posts, on the walls). 3. Rule: 80% a marked area on the ship gets damage. 4. Choose one of two types of damage: scratches or water damage. 

### Notes
- I mentioned this in class but check out the film "Waterworld". The same concept as what you are describing. Maybe there are some other visual/thematic references yo can glean from it. Also look at "Treasure Planet" if you are not familiar some rally cool space "ships" in that one too.
- From what I understand , you are interested in doing a pirate ship. I think this provides some good opportunity for some procedural modeling. I'd imagine you cold start will the main hull and then procedurally place objects and other components, like the side panels, based on some rules/placement logic. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizNmJ0iVEI and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhjYaKB-5J4
- The damage  you mentioned to some parts can also be done with some procedural logic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSrG6mYgk5Q
- I agree great lighting will be crucial here. You also have the opportunity to develop a nice water shader for the sip to move through in unity (when we get to that point)

## Wells Labbe
### From Student
I interpreted the theme “So What About Tomorrow?” as referencing time travel or time manipulation.  The ability to affect something in one area and influence the next is a cool gameplay mechanic, and is often brought to life through tech art.  I’ve decided to go with the time travel/alternate reality route because it's more interesting and is a better foundation for me to practice the skills learned in class. Abandoned vs. Unkempt environment player can navigate.  Activating the timepiece would be the biggest factor to get right, as I want to add a lot of cool shaders and particle effects that make the player feel like they are being transformed through time.  And with proper lighting, I can visually imply a large change in time with daylight and artificial lighting within the scene.  The camera will also distort and warp to indicate a passage in time/shift in location. The project will be a small walkable Unity environment with specific objects that shift/change when the player uses their timepiece, a prop they will hold and use to navigate the level.  The idea (hopefully) is that players will realize activating the timepiece not only helps them progress, but is shifting the time they are in between past/present. The most ambitious aspect will be how large/varied the environment is.
### Notes
- You have some rally strong mechanical and thematic references to go along with a really good and strong game-based metaphor of your interpretation on the theme! Also have a look at "The Medium"(Video game) if you are not familiar with is. Similar vibes to what you are exploring; but a more paranormal twist to it.
- As I mentioned, the tutorial for the "dynamic lighting" in Unity is actually a day/night cycle, so it should work well for that  you want (will likely need tweaking of course).
- I would (as I mention to basically everyone) start simple with the environment. Start with the same base model/mesh and then selectively scatter some assets/primitives for the two versions of reality. You can always go back alter and really build it up.
- Your project is also going to provide some good opportunity to build out some very nice parametrically-controlled shaders and VFX. If you think about what you want to change between the two spaces, color, speed of animations, lighting, etc. you can build something mopre modular that can be used across both versions; instead of making two of everything.

### From Student
The theme brings up this idea of recovering from destruction, like a forest slowly becoming green decades after a nuclear fallout. I want to convey a feeling of beauty in survival. I like the idea that even if humanity suffers, the environment will always regain its footing. I like to learn about the weird things that human bodies are capable of, and the way our bodies react to foreign things. In most cases, it’s not good; But while humans have limited time on Earth to live fully, the Earth will be here long past us and will inevitably recover from anything we throw at it; Regardless of whether humans are here or not. I’d like to create a small forest scene with evidence of some sort of large scale disaster. As the player approaches the scene, the area will begin to regrow. Or perhaps the opposite; A luscious forest that will decay as the player approaches. 

### Notes
- Your interpretation and concept are really good! You have also provided some very strong refences for that visual metaphor of your project idea.
- One thing to consider is how you want this growth/decay interaction to work. I can currently image two main ways to achieve this. One is to model/source some base geometry and then procedurally create some plants that can "grow (decay in reverse)" on that base geometry. This videos should give a good starting point to doing something like that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSkaM-8Vgz8 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1Ehl-q6x44. The second is to make this shader-based, with something like a decay shader (again growth would be the inverse). So you would model out the full scene with foliage and apply the shader, then control the activation somehow to either decay or "grow" the scene geometry. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMc4xLWtcMM&t=0s
- Deciding on this soon will be beneficial to sort of determine how to proceed with the modeling and other systems.

### Notes
- So based on what you are describing, the trash assets you are going to be developing will like benefit from some scattering of random objects on a single base object: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhEOff23nM.
- One of your main considerations is going to be what to scatter and having some optimized versions of those smaller pieces. Try to stay away from spheres with high poly count, this will kill performance.
- Another consideration is the space. You have this wonderful Wall-E reference, and if you want to build out both the space/environment and also build some assets, they will really be using similar/same procedural modeling concepts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skiTFG9EeYk and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4orZAsyUA7c
- As I've mentioned, star smaller here, maybe 5-6 different base assets to scatter, you can always some back later and add more. Build up a simple terrain and then define the logic to scatter objects on different parts. For the actual trash assets, start with a cube (like Wall-E) and scatter the same base assets onto the cube.
- Your project complete will also benefit from a good layering of particles and other components to build out the more more full/robust effect of trash.

### From Student
I chose a concept where in you exist in a varied and hostile landscape full of abandoned technology. You need to modify your body to survive. It's a take on an apocalyptic future where the environment and hostile architecture is your main enemy. Planning your survival is key.
For the final project I want to make a character who can attach and integrate objects he finds to his body using procedural modeling/geometry nodes. This way I can make a system for attaching and removing items without modeling the final look of the character for each possible combination.
### Notes
- This is a really good interpretation and really intriguing project concept. I had someone do a similar idea with a robot that has interchangeable parts. What you are really dealing with here is a form of a "real-time" character builder system.
- Now, depending on how you want to approach this will determine the scope/level of modeling vs system-building. As you are describing the interaction, it feel a bit more systems-oriented; picking up and applying different parts as the player moves around. 
- One you your main considerations is going to eb scale of objects and pivot points or where each body part attaches, this will need to be consistent for the "base" controller. 
- Start simple, maybe jus two different variations of arms, legs, torso, head, etc. And then you'll need to code the system for "picking up" and "snapping" those parts into place in Unity.
- Another take would be to have just a simple humanoid base mesh with a bunch of attachments points all over the base mesh as ass the player moves through and interacts with objects they snap to those points. Bu this approach seems less intentional and less aligned with your initial moodboard and references.

Concept ● Create a Mech hanger overlooking a procedurally generated Space colony. ● The player will be able to walk around the hangar. Scope ● This is somewhat ambitious for my skill sets but, the difficulty is something I am willing to meet. ● I learn best in trial-by-fire scenarios so I am ready for a challenge ● I also want to get more used to using Blender so, I can eventually try to use this scene for either another game I make in the future or to put into an already existing g

### Notes
- I really like the theme interpretation and overall concept/project idea.
- I agree the scope seems ambitious, so start simple. It seems the Mech Hanger is more of the "hero asset" so start there. Identify what in this hangar could be procedurally generated or modeled, even if just cosmetic; like pipes, window/prop placements, etc. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrxN-qCpRLc The colony will also be a good practice in procedurally scattering some very low fidelity assts, especially given it is not the main focus, keep it simple an low poly for this (optimization). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-JvsnheaGg
- I think having some sketches or a graybox of the space, just to see how things will look compositionally and what room the player will move in will help deterring much of what is/needs to be done procedurally.

### From Student
Theme Interpretation ● When I think of “What About Tomorrow”, I think of how technology advances and what sort of tech might exist in the future. ● Naturally this leads to thinking about robots and how they have integrated into everyday life. ● An interesting take on robotic integration is thinking about how organic life might combine with or get replaced by robotic forms. ● Like cyborg or robotic fish! Imagine being at an aquarium and all the sea life are cyborgs or straight up robots! That’d be pretty interesting.

Initial Project Proposal ● An interactive futuristic aquarium that features schools of mechanical sea life swimming around ○ Interactables might include buttons and screens near attractions that would tell you about the various sea life contained within it (maybe through a hologram or something similar) ○ Could also shed light on what the story is for this place style ● Visual style: I was thinking along the lines of a less crude/dystopian cyberpunk kind of ● Of the four modules, I think Modeling + Lighting interests me most
### Notes
- I think this is a wonderful interpretation on the theme!
- It seems that your main "hero asset" will be the school of fish that are both organic and "hard surface" in their form. I wouls star wimple 2 - 3 fish (more can be made later) and decide which parts are organics and which parts are not. Then you could model those pieces separately and combine them with some boolean operations.
- The real important bit is getting the "swam" to work. Now there are a couple of ways to do this. One would be to do it all in a dcc (like blender) and export the simulation/animation for playback in Unity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpyilKAY2fM. Another method is to use Unity VFX graph to create the swarm (particle system VFX) and then using your fish models to spawn onto the points of the swarm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgXJVmsrD0
- Either way, start with the fish models, simple at first, then you can begin to work on the swarm/school aspect.
- Also s you mentioned, this would be another opportunity for some great lighting and a good water shader to tie it all together.

For this class, I took the prompt of "so what about tomorrow?" in two very different directions. My original idea was to design a procedural spaceship creator, where the user is able to design their own spaceships, which is likely the idea I will be working with. However, I had a second idea to take "so what" in a dismissive way, and design something inspired by the 1990's and the technology of that era. I will ultimately be combining the two ideas, with a spaceship creation tool that relies heavily on science fiction visuals from eras past and blends them with more contemporary imaginings of what space travel could look like in the future. 

### Notes
- This is tangentially related, but there is a really great UI/UX design book that explore interfaces from across science fiction, and how different era interpreted technological interaction. Its called "Make It So": https://www.flickr.com/photos/rosenfeldmedia/albums/72157630803808152/
-  I really enjoy your interpretation of the theme and you idea to blend you two idea together; I think this will l work well!
- What you have described is something like a character customizer or vehicle customizer, with different parts from different "eras" of "tomorrow". So snapping and pivot points will be crucial for this project. Ensuring the points where things will snap (pivots) are aligned properly for the base parts. Then in Unity it will be all about building the system to snap thigs together and make parts interchangeable.
- As I mentioned, I would start wimple maybe 2-3 version as of a hull, wings (l/r), thrusters, etc. Ensure correct pivots and import to Unity to build the system.
- have a look at these tutorials, hopefully they can provide a good starting point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSmEirb8JGM and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNdDooxZY90 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY62cJk9i30

Then in Unity it will be all about building the system to snap things together and make parts interchangeable.

As I mentioned, I would start with simple maybe 2-3 versions of a hull, wings (l/r), thrusters, etc. Ensure correct pivots and import to Unity to build the system.

Have a look at these tutorials, hopefully they can provide a good starting point: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSmEirb8JGM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSmEirb8JGM) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNdDooxZY90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNdDooxZY90) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY62cJk9i30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY62cJk9i30)

Theme Interpretation-Technological advancements of tomorrow-Robots and AI growing in innovation-How close are we to the “unrealistic” sci-fi vision of technology?-Project Concept: An environment that changes futuristically as the player walks through it

### Notes
- I like teh theme interpretation and the general concept idea. I think rally determining the space/environment and how you imagine interaction happening, proximity based, "touching parts" etc. will hep determine how to begin building in earnest.
- Based off of what you described I think one good approach would be to have just a "base" interior model. Create some simple futuristic and "present day" versions of the props and parts of the building. Keep it simple to start pick 2-3 things. Then in Unity you can make a system to essentially swap/snap those objects into place based on the player proximity to them.
- For this project concept pivot points and scale are crucial. You'll want to layout everything in the DCCs to ensure the scale is correct and them determine where thigs will spawn/snap to (pivot point).

### Final Feedback
I like the theme interpretation and the general concept idea. I think really determining the space/environment and how you imagine interaction happening, proximity based, "touching parts" etc. will help determine how to begin building in earnest.

I want to create remnants of a human settlement in the ashes of a world torn up by rising temperatures. In the ashes of the old world people have organized into nomadic communities that move with the shifting pollution storms and insect colonies. Despite the harsh environment they have found ways to survive and thrive. I want to illustrate this by not just showing methods of survival but also the art they have developed in their crafts. Traditional weaves and jewelry made from left repurposed materials. 
Material Aging: To make the concept work I will need a lot of ruined materials. Still like walls, metals, maybe a vehicle husk with weathering patterns would be nice. Lighting: Lighting is something I never seem to get to in my projects. I often rely on unlit textures instead. It would be nice to have lighting changes with pollution clouds rolling through.

### Notes
- As I mentioned check out "Shuna's Journey": I think it has similar themes/vibes to what you are exploring: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250846525/shunasjourney/
- You have a very strong interpretation of the theme and the visual moodbard/references to match! 
- Since you have such a focus on the materials and lighting it may be beneficial to look into some procedural materials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxlAV6k4Jf4 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAAGKr6wCRA
- I know you mentioned using maya and bifrost, so you could have a look at doing some rocks and terrain procedurally to get that into Unity.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM9Bo10wTns
