- Submitted Unity Project files. Not what was requested for deliverables section of ASN 2 brief.
- I am glad you found a solution to constrain the rotation of your portal stones to the z-axis only.
- I think the rotation for the portal stones is great. The periodic nature of its rotation makes it feel mechanical, along with the lighting choices.
- Maybe consider having and effect or lights (or both) triggered when a new rotation begins in the script.

- Use of several layered shader-graph and material effects for different assets. Very good.
- Your said there was an issue with the code for the shaders, the tweening is not behaving as expected. I believe this was resolved in our later Office Hours. Correct me if wrong.
- I love the "space" or galactic theme for your assets. The sparkling stars shader/material is very nice.
- Maybe introduce some motion into the "rings" asst. Break each ring / section into its own separate asset and animate them with DOTween.

### est49 - Ethan - 90
- You have your bicycle scene in unity with some lighting on the frame and other section ativated via shader and materials. Very good.
- I like the shudder effect on the tires, I wonder if it can be more "substantial" in the number of pieces around the tires.
-  I am curious, and this may require some procedural animation, so may be outside scope, but I am curious if you can fine a way to "parent" the tentacle chain on the frame so only the middle section animates?

### hhr25 - Hyungwoo - 100
- You have imported you procedural and organic forms into Unity and applied lighting and shaders in a very meaningful and intentional manner. Very well done!
- I love the explanations/metaphors for your design choice in the context of the theme.
- Great use of scripting to produce procedural animation for the body. Perhaps the body motion can be constrained further down (closer to the feathers start) so it appears to follow the motion of the head more. 
- Very creative solutions overall!

### jg3747 - Joshua - 90
- You have your procedural assets imported, lighted, and activated via shaders and materials for the portal and "enemy" asset. Very good!
- The flickering effect on the portal works very well, even if unintentional. One of those happy accidents. I think there is also some nice alpha transparency as well.
- One thing that could work well is to apply some "flicker" to the lights to match as well, maybe just during portal open and enemy spawn.

### jhz25 - Johnathan - 95
- You have imported your procedural assets and applied some shading and materials to them. 
- You identified an issue with the UVs and made changes/workarounds to fix. Nice work!
- Nice work scripting the interactivity and defining the metaphors for the shader and object interaction ins real time.
- Something you could to to test the other eye shader in the meantime is using some primitives to apply the shader/material and reviewing the effect in real-time.

### kaw434 - Kai - 85
- After the OneDrive incident you were able to rebuild some stuff in Unity and apply your assets with some shaders and materials.
- Very nice blending of procedural patterns for your shaders
- Great references and metaphor. 
- I think it would be beneficial to apply some more "detailing" or interaction with the tower as it seems to be more the focal point and it would be good to see it more in context.

### mr3773 - Monty - 90
- You have imported you procedural assets made with your tree tool from blender an applied some "exploded view" type shader/material. Very cool!
- Funny enough, your very intentional shader looks like a broken vertex animation texture if the data doesn't write properly, it is really a good implementation.
- I would like to see how lights effect/play along with this shader.
- I  think it could be really interesting to see , from a game mechanic metaphor, how the shader is behaving with something like a player distance control. Maybe as the player approaches, the shader becomes more volatile or fragmented.
  

### om335 - Owen - 90
- You have applied your procedural assets to unity and affected them with shaders and materials, nice work!
- I am glad you discovered an algorithm that is working better for your interaction with the shader, after some initial struggles.
- I think it could be cool to apply some procedural noise texturing to the flashing shader to give an almost shimmering effect. This paired with some particles in the future has potential to look even better.
