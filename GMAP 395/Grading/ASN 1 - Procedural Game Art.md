- I really like the direction you took with the tendrils
- Maybe the tendrils could have some mesh combining to make them smoother. I know this is more challenging with geometry nodes.
- The portal stones are also great and really have some good implied motion to their form with alternating patterns
- The reference and inspiration with Vel'Koz LoL is awesome and a really good starting point. i wonder how more of that will inspire your designs
- Good mix of mechanical and organic design inspo. I wonder how this will be balance with other assets. 


### cy437 - Chuanhui - 95
- Sorry there was confusion on what to submit. i will try to make clearer in future iterations.
- I like that you chose to "play with the numbers" this trial and error/experimentation is really good for exploring options, and sometimes solutions are jus found this way.
- I like the inspo you started from. Maybe in future projects, spend some time defining the "cohesion between them"
- I see hat you mean with the differences in the "ring," but you version is also strong and authentic. It reminds me of 3d reps of neurons?
- Great creative use of lighting too

### est49 - Ethan - 95
- You make a very good point and observation about the design principles and affordances of "simple" objects. A good place to start is with some solid inspo and mood board. Look at as many options as possible and try to discern what resonates with you.
- I love the mixing of "disparate" ideas like lovecraftian and bike. Love very creative things happen when that thinking is applied.
- One possible way to extend bike design is to increase the resolution of your splines to create more "organic" shapes.

### hhr25 - Hyungwoo - 100
- Wow, the organic form is great!
- honestly so impressing with your knowledge and creative application. I have used the feather workflow in Houdini quite a bit, even for a recent research project, and to see the Blender application/version of this is wonderful.
- You are obviously thinking real-time workflow using quad textures for feathers, but I am curious how a pure spline feather could work as well. Using sample positions to essentially grow more splines (feathers) from them
- If you are not already familiar you may be interested in the work of Artist And Thomas: https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2014/08/audio-life-forms-andy-thomas/

### jg3747 - Joshua - 95
- I am so glad you chose to some to office hours, more people should do that! also trusting the process and understanding that things are not perfect or correct the first time around is an excellent mindset to have.
- Also experimenting and trial and error is a HUGE part of working procedurally/algorithmically. sometimes you have to test numbers and solutions may arise from that experimentation.
- I really enjoy the organic form you have come up with, one critique is possibly increasing resolutions for final render really sell "organic". Or maybe its like "organic rock"? interesting to think about.

### jhz25 - Johnathan - 95
- Well not knowing, is honestly the first step to learning, so great to recognize that. But I would say trust your knowledge more, you'd be surprised at how much you can figure and "know" quickly.
- The form of the ring structure is really strong.
- The eyes are a great direction to go for the theme, very "Argus Panoptes". I think something to consider is the final resolution of some of the assets, especially eyes.
- Color choice also really good. Experiment with combining different lights and blending some color via lights that way to bring that out more!

### kaw434 - Kai - 95
- Nice direction shift with the tower, the way it emerges from the portal is really strong visually and I can definitely see the direction.
- One possible suggestion for the tower is to maybe scatter some more points in the final mesh and the apply some other flat rectangles (or other shapes guess it depends on the architectural direction) to act as thresholds (doorways/windows)
- Something to look into as well in maybe having some "chunks" of the tower missing, via like boolean subtraction with the final  mesh
- README was empty, so I think you got everything fine based on video.


### mr3773 - Monty -95
- The tree workflow is great. I am curious how it compares to Houdini's, like if there are dedicated tools to this. As you described, seems like you are doing it all manually. If there are l-systems, great for plants.
- You clearly have a good grasp on the procedural workflows based your readme. Did you use and logic for deleting the points by selection? I am curious what options there are.
- Now I would like to see how you utilize the great tree generator tool you built in an artistic manor withing the theme. 

### om335 - Owen - 95
- I am so glad you brough up the point about duplicating objects i the way you described. So copy/paste, duplication,e tc. is a major part of procedural 3d. But if you want you instances to look different? Well, you need to use an embeded/multilevel procuduralism. esentially the object syou want to instance themselves need to be generated procedurally, then you apply random number to exposed parameter to get a different version with each instance. There are different ways to do this, but that is essentially the gist.
- The form/shape of the crystal is awesome! There is definably some room to play with shaders (alpha, transparency/ reflection) for crystals like structures. Excited to see what you do.
- Great solution to creating variety with rocks. maybe you can try to develop a "rock generator" ten use outputs for future work?
