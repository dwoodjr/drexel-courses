# üïπÔ∏è **GMAP 395: Final Project Guide**

## üéØ Project Overview

Students will create a **polished, interactive game art piece** by focusing on **one module of their choice** from the course. This final deliverable will showcase their technical and artistic skills while demonstrating mastery of the selected module.

---

## üß© Module-Specific Requirements

Each module for the final includes **main requirements** and **one additional challenge** to practice development, critical-thinking, and creativity.

### üì¶ Module 1: Procedural Modeling + Lighting Systems
> **Original Requirements**:
> - ‚úÖ Create a **procedural or modular system** for props, characters, or environments.
> - ‚úÖ Integrate **at least three lighting sources**: one directional light and two auxiliary lights (e.g., point, spot, area lights).
> - ‚úÖ Use modular assets to build a cohesive scene.
> - ‚úÖ Incorporate a **dynamic lighting element**, like a day-night cycle or interactive light source.

> **üîß Additional Requirement**:
> - Add an **advanced procedural element**, such as animated modular components or interactive environmental changes (e.g., destructible props, dynamic weather systems).

---

### üñåÔ∏è Module 2: Shaders and Materials Development
> **Original Requirements**:
> - ‚úÖ Develop at least **two custom shaders** using Shader Graph or HLSL.
> - ‚úÖ Include shaders with **dynamic properties**, like adjustable emission, transparency, or surface effects.
> - ‚úÖ Ensure shaders are cohesive with the overall project aesthetic.

> **üîß Additional Requirement**:
> - Design a **shader with user-driven interactions** or environmental triggers (e.g., heat distortion near light sources, ripple effects when interacted with).

---

### ‚ú® Module 3: Effects + Particle Systems
> **Original Requirements**:
> - ‚úÖ Create **at least three particle systems** dynamically triggered by player actions (e.g., sparks, smoke, mist).
> - ‚úÖ Use modular techniques for particle creation (e.g., reusable templates, layered systems).
> - ‚úÖ Ensure effects are **integrated** within a cohesive game art scene.

> **üîß Additional Requirement**:
> - Build a **reactive particle system** that changes based on environmental conditions or time (e.g., intensity, color, or behavior adjusting to a day-night cycle).

---

### üé• Module 4: Camera Effects + Post-Processing
> **Original Requirements**:
> - ‚úÖ Implement a **dynamic camera system** using Cinemachine.
> - ‚úÖ Add **at least two post-processing effects** (e.g., bloom, color grading, depth of field) to enhance visual quality.
> - ‚úÖ Use camera animations or transitions to highlight specific parts of the scene.

> **üîß Additional Requirement**:
> - Develop a **camera-based interaction system**, such as zoom-in on specific triggers or focus shifts during player interactions.

## üìã Deliverables
> [!todo] **What to Submit**
> 
> 1. **Interactive Scene**:
>     - A fully developed Unity scene meeting the requirements of the selected module.
>     - The scene must be cohesive, polished, and technically proficient.
> 2. **Playthrough Video**:
>     - A 10-minute video showcasing the final project.
>     - Include **annotations or narration** explaining key design decisions.
> 3. **Postmortem Document**:
>     - A 1‚Äì2 page reflection including:
>         - **üéâ Successes**: Highlight key achievements.
>         - **üòÖ Challenges**: Discuss difficulties and solutions.
>         - **üìö Learning Outcomes**: Share what you‚Äôve learned.
>     - Include citations for any external assets used.
> 4. **Unity Project Files**:
>     - A zipped folder with only the necessary files: **Assets**, **Packages**, **ProjectSettings** ONLY (‚ùå omit the Library, Temp, and other folders).
> 5. **Polished Build**:
>     - A **playable Windows build** demonstrating your project.
