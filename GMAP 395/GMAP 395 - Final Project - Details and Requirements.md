# 🕹️ ***GMAP 395: Final Project Guide**

## 🎯 Project Overview

Students will create a **polished, interactive game art piece** by focusing on **one module of their choice** from the course to do the *Additional Requirements* for. This final deliverable will showcase their technical and artistic skills while demonstrating mastery of the selected module.

> [!NOTE] Requirements vs Additional Requirements
> The "Requirements" for all four modules are *required for all projects*. You will choose ***one*** module to complete the "Additional Requirement" for to complete the final project.
> 
> The "polished game art piece" you will make for the final *is the same work* you have been doing for the whole quarter. You are not required to make new work, just polish your existing assets.

## 🧩 Module-Specific Requirements

Each module for the final includes **main requirements** and **one additional challenge** to practice development, critical-thinking, and creativity.

### 📦 Module 1: Procedural Modeling + Lighting Systems
> **Requirements**:
> - ✅ Create a **procedural or modular** for prop, character, or environment. If only one part of your asset is procedurally created, that is okay.
> - ✅ Integrate **at least two lighting sources**: one directional light and one auxiliary lights (e.g., point, spot, area lights).
> - ✅ Use modular assets to build a cohesive scene.

> **🔧 Additional Requirement**:
> - Add an **advanced procedural element**, such as animated modular components or interactive environmental changes (e.g., destructible props, dynamic weather systems).

---

### 🖌️ Module 2: Shaders and Materials Development
> **Requirements**:
> - ✅ Develop at least **one custom shader** using Shader Graph or HLSL.
> - ✅ Ensure shaders are cohesive with the overall project aesthetic.

> **🔧 Additional Requirement**:
> - Design a **shader with user-driven interactions** (for *both required shaders*) activated by user interaction or environmental triggers (e.g., heat distortion near light sources, ripple effects when interacted with). **This means control it with code.**
---

### ✨ Module 3: Effects + Particle Systems
> **Requirements**:
> - ✅ Create **at least two particle systems** (e.g., sparks, smoke, mist).
> - ✅ Use modular techniques for particle creation (e.g., reusable templates, layered systems).
> - ✅ Ensure effects are **integrated** within a cohesive game art scene.

> **🔧 Additional Requirement**:
> - Build a **reactive particle system** (for *2 of the 3* required systems) that changes based on environmental conditions, player interaction, or time (e.g., intensity, color, or behavior adjusting to a day-night cycle). **This means control it with code.**

---

### 🎥 Module 4: Camera Effects + Post-Processing
> **Requirements**:
> - ✅ Implement **Cinemachine**.
> - ✅ Add **at least two post-processing effects** (e.g., bloom, color grading, depth of field) to enhance visual quality.
> - ✅ Use camera animations or transitions to highlight specific parts of the scene.

> **🔧 Additional Requirement**:
> - Develop a **camera-based interaction system**, such as zoom-in on specific triggers or focus shifts during player interactions and manipulate (*1 of the 2* required post-process effects) based on player interaction of environmental triggers. **This means control it with code.**

## 📋 Deliverables
> [!todo] **What to Submit**
> 
> 1. **Interactive Scene**:
>     - A fully developed Unity scene meeting the requirements of the selected module.
>     - The scene must be cohesive, polished, and technically proficient.
> 2. **Playthrough Video**:
>     - A 10-minute video showcasing the final project.
>     - Include **annotations or narration** explaining key design decisions.
> 3. **Postmortem Document**:
>     - A 1–2 page reflection including:
>         - **Successes**: Highlight key achievements.
>         - **Challenges**: Discuss difficulties and solutions.
>         - **Learning Outcomes**: Share what you’ve learned.
>     - *Include citations for any external assets used.*
> 4. **Unity Project Files**:
>     - A zipped folder with only the necessary files: **Assets**, **Packages**, **ProjectSettings** ONLY (❌ omit the Library, Temp, and other folders).
> 5. **Polished Build**:
>     - A **playable Windows build** demonstrating your project.

> [!warning] Requirements
> For each module there are a set of **Requirements** that must be met for every module. Then there are **Additional Requirements** that must only be met for whichever module you choose to polish for the final.

## 🏆 Grading Criteria
Your project will be evaluated based on:
- **Technical Mastery**: Effective use of tools and workflows from the chosen module.
- **Creativity and Originality**: Innovative and thoughtful design choices.
- **Cohesion**: Visual and thematic consistency throughout the project.
- **Polish**: Overall quality and refinement of the interactive experience.
- **Presentation**: Clarity and professionalism in the playthrough video and postmortem document.
