## What are Node-Based Workflows?

**Node-based workflows use visual scripting and data-driven approaches to create procedural systems and assets.** Instead of writing traditional code, you connect visual nodes that represent specific operations, creating a flowchart-like system that's both powerful and accessible to artists.

### How Node Systems Work

**Nodes represent specific tasks or operations:**
- **Input Nodes**: Provide data to the system (geometry, textures, parameters)
- **Processing Nodes**: Modify or transform data (scale, rotate, duplicate, filter)
- **Output Nodes**: Generate final results (meshes, materials, effects)

**Connections define data flow:**
- Data flows from left to right or top to bottom (typically)
- Each connection carries specific types of information
- Visual feedback shows how changes propagate through the system

## Introduction to DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)

### What is a DAG?

A **Directed Acyclic Graph** is a structure where:
- **Directed**: Connections flow in one direction (like water flowing downstream)
- **Acyclic**: No loops or circular references that would create infinite processing (typically)
- **Graph**: Network of connected nodes representing relationships

### Why DAGs Matter in Game Art

**Non-linear workflows** enable:
- **Iterative development**: Change parameters anywhere in the chain
- **Modular construction**: Swap out pieces without rebuilding everything
- **Dependency management**: Clear understanding of how changes affect final output

**Applications in Game Development:**
- Organizing and optimizing procedural pipelines
- Managing dependencies between assets and systems
- Building complex modeling, texturing, or animation workflows
- Creating real-time gameplay systems

## Basic Node Network Concepts

### Data Types
- **Geometry**: 3D mesh data, points, edges, faces
- **Attributes**: Properties attached to geometry (color, scale, rotation)
- **Numbers**: Float values, integers, vectors
- **Boolean**: True/false logic for conditional operations

### Common Node Categories

#### **Input Nodes**
- **Primitive Objects**: Basic shapes (cube, sphere, plane)
- **Import Nodes**: External data (models, images, point clouds)
- **Parameter Controls**: User-adjustable values and settings

#### **Processing Nodes**
- **Transform Operations**: Move, rotate, scale geometry
- **Duplication Systems**: Arrays, scattering, instancing
- **Deformation Tools**: Bend, twist, noise displacement
- **Boolean Operations**: Combine, subtract, intersect geometry

#### **Utility Nodes**
- **Math Operations**: Add, multiply, compare values
- **Conditional Logic**: If/then statements for branching behavior
- **Random Generators**: Controlled variation and noise
- **Attribute Manipulation**: Reading and writing object properties

## Learning Check: Node Network Design

> [!question] Visual Thinking Exercise (3-4 minutes) **Sketch a Simple Node Network:** Think of any simple creative process and draw it as connected boxes with arrows. Examples could be:
> 
> - Making breakfast (ingredients → cooking steps → final dish)
> - Getting dressed (choosing clothes → putting them on → final outfit)
> - Creating a simple drawing (basic shapes → details → colors → finished art)
> - Or any process you can think of!
> 
> **Drawing Guidelines:**
> 
> - Use simple boxes for each step
> - Label each box with what happens
> - Use arrows to show the order/flow
> - Think about: What do I start with? What steps transform it? What's the result?

**The goal:** Practice thinking in "data flow" - how information or materials move from step to step to create something new.

## Node-Based Thinking Strategies

### Start Simple, Build Complexity
1. **Begin with basic operations** and verify each step
2. **Add complexity gradually** rather than building everything at once
3. **Test frequently** to catch issues early in the process

### Think in Data Flow
- **What information do I start with?** (input data)
- **What transformations do I need?** (processing steps)
- **What's my desired end result?** (output goals)

### Embrace Modular Design
- **Group related operations** into reusable components
- **Create parameter interfaces** for easy adjustment
- **Build libraries** of useful node groups for future projects

### Optimize for Iteration
- **Expose key parameters** at the top level for easy access
- **Use preview modes** to work with simplified data during development
- **Document your networks** with clear naming and organization
