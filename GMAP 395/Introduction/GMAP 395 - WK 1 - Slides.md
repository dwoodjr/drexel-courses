### Core Elements of Game Design
1. **Rules:**
   - The boundaries that define what players can and cannot do.
   - Examples: Movement rules, scoring systems, and constraints.
2. **Systems:**
   - Interconnected rules that shape gameplay experiences.
   - Examples: Resource management, combat mechanics, or crafting systems.
3. **Player Experience:**
   - The overarching goal of game design is to evoke emotions and sustain player engagement.

--

### Iterative Game Design Process
1. **Conceptualize:**
   - Generate ideas and define the game’s objectives.
   - Example Activities:
     - Brainstorm themes and mechanics.
     - Identify the target audience.
2. **Prototype:**
   - Create a basic, playable version of the game.
   - Example Activities:
     - Build a simple demo with placeholder assets.
3. **Playtest:**
   - Test with real players to observe how they interact with the game.
   - Example Activities:
     - Record player feedback.
4. **Evaluate:**
   - Analyze feedback and refine mechanics and systems.
   - Example Activities:
     - Identify areas of improvement.
     - Implement changes and repeat the cycle.

### Importance of Iteration
- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Iteration allows designers to refine ideas based on real-world feedback.
- **Learning from Failure:**
  - Unsuccessful elements provide insights for improvement.
- **Key Takeaway:** The best games are shaped through repeated cycles of creation, testing, and refinement.

### A Note on Designing Everyday Things
- **Games as Everyday Things:**
  - Video games are modern artifacts of daily interaction, much like physical tools or interfaces.
  - Designing games requires the same care and consideration as designing everyday objects.

![[GMAP 395/Introduction/design-everyday-things.jpg]]

--

### Key Design Principles (from Don Norman)
Key principles from ***The Design of Everyday Things***
1. **Affordances:**
   - Elements that suggest how they should be used.
 *  In games: *A glowing door suggests it can be opened, or a bouncy surface implies jumping.*
2. **Constraints:**
   - Limitations that guide user interaction.
   - In games: *Invisible walls, restricted areas, or locked abilities.*
3. **Feedback:**
   - Immediate response to actions.
   - In games: *Sound effects, visual cues, or vibrations indicating success or failure.*
4. **Signifiers:**
   - Visual or auditory cues that communicate functionality.
   - In games: *Icons, markers, or prompts that guide players.*

--

### Why It Matters
- **Clarity in Design:**
  - Clear affordances and signifiers reduce player frustration.
- **Player Intuition:**
  - Well-designed constraints and feedback align with natural player expectations.
- **Games as Interfaces:**
  - Like everyday tools, games rely on good design to be engaging and accessible.

  - **Imaginative:** Often involves creativity, make-believe, or exploration.
  - **Intrinsically Motivated:** Done for its own sake, without external rewards.
  - **Bounded:** Occurs within defined limits (rules, time, or space).
- **Why Play Matters:**
  - Satisfies intrinsic human needs like autonomy, competence, and relatedness.
