If you're completely new to Blender and geometry nodes, watch these two YouTube tutorials. They provide an excellent introduction to getting started with the software. Don't worry about mastering Blender immediatelyâ€”you'll become more comfortable as you use it more (this applies to any tool or software).

# In-Class Demo for Week 1 - "Brickify": Blender GN Version
In this demo video (similar to the one given during our Week 1 class) we are trying to create a system of rules/algorithms/procedures for turning any mesh geometry into In this demo video (similar to the one shown in our Week 1 class), we're creating a system of rules, algorithms, and procedures for converting any mesh geometry into "Lego" bricks. The approach is based on this [Houdini FX Tutorial](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/foundations-nodes-networks-assets/). The logic behind this modular and procedural system uses common procedural modeling techniques like "copy to points" and node-based vertex manipulation. Some of these concepts are covered in [[GAMP 395 - Introduction - B]].
