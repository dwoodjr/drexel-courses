### 9. Mesh Emission in VFX
- What is Mesh Emission?
    - Using 3D models as particle emitters instead of simple point sources
- Why Use Meshes?
    - Enables complex particle behaviors
    - Aligns particles with character movements
    - Creates detailed environmental effects

---

### 10. Implementing Mesh Emission in VFX Graph
1. Import a mesh asset
2. Set it as the emitter in the VFX Graph
3. Control particle emission based on mesh attributes
4. Adjust parameters for density and speed

### 11. Decals in VFX Graph
- What are Decals?
    - 2D images projected onto 3D surfaces
- Use Cases:
    - Blood splatters, bullet holes, footprints
    - Magic circles, surface-based energy effects
- Performance Benefits:
    - Add detail without modifying geometry
    - Can be animated dynamically in VFX Graph

    - Modify properties like opacity, glow, and texture movement

---

### 17. Combining VFX Graph and Shaders for Dynamic Effects
- Example Workflow:
    1. Create a VFX Graph system for an explosion
    2. Apply Shader Graph to control particle visuals
    3. Use real-time parameters (e.g., intensity, color) to adjust shader properties
- Benefit: More integrated, seamless visual effects

---

### 18. Real-Time Shader Control in VFX
- Modifying Shader Properties via Gameplay
    - Connecting game events to VFX shader parameters
    - Examples:
        - Fire effect that intensifies when a player is near
        - Magic aura that fades when a spell ends

---

### 19. Implementing Real-Time Shader Control
1. Expose shader parameters to Unityâ€™s inspector
2. Modify them in real-time using scripts
3. Link parameters to gameplay events
4. Optimize for performance

### 20. Performance Considerations for VFX
- Balancing visual fidelity and frame rate
    - Avoiding overdraw in transparent particle effects
    - Reducing unnecessary GPU calculations
    - Using GPU instancing for efficient rendering

---

### 21. Optimization Strategies
- Limit Simultaneous effects: Fewer complex effect splaying at one time
- Reduce Particle Lifetime: Shorter effects reduce CPU/GPU load
- Use "LODs" for Effects: Lower detail for distance effects

- Example:
    - How _Control_ (Remedy Entertainment) handles interactive lighting & destruction effects
    - How *Destiny 2* (Bungie) uses shader-driven energy effects to create responsive player abilities
