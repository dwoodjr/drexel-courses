# Assignment 3: Effects and Particle Systems

## Overview

> [!info] Assignment Overview  
> In this assignment, students will:
> 
> 1. Implement **particle systems** and/or **visual effects** into their procedural game asset created in **Assignment 1**.
> 2. Use Unity’s **Particle System (Shuriken)** or **VFX Graph** to generate interactive and dynamic visual effects.
> 3. Ensure the effects align with the class theme: _Something from the Void_.
> 4. Integrate basic C# scripting to trigger or control the effects dynamically.
> 5. Present their work as a **Unity scene**, with a **README file** documenting their process and a **recorded video walkthrough**.

## Assignment Details

### Theme: Something from the Void

> [!question] How to Approach the Theme  
> The theme _Something from the Void_ should guide the design of your effects. Consider:
> 
> - **Cosmic and Abstract:** Floating mist, swirling void energy, or ethereal particles.
> - **Horror and Mystery:** Dark fog, flickering embers, spectral trails.
> - **Otherworldly Technology:** Electric sparks, pulsing energy bursts, mechanical steam vents.

### Part 1: Creating Particle Effects

> [!note] Key Steps for Part 1
> 
> 1. Choose a **particle system type**:
>     - **Shuriken Particle System (Unity's Standard System)**
>     - **VFX Graph (for more advanced GPU-based effects)**
> 2. Design particle effects that **complement your procedural asset**.
> 3. Implement **at least two** of the following particle behaviors:
>     - **Emission Control** (e.g., burst-based, looping, randomized rates)
>     - **Lifetime Modulation** (e.g., fading particles, size variation over time)
>     - **Force Interaction** (e.g., gravity, wind, turbulence fields)
>     - **Material Shaders** (e.g., glowing effects, transparency, additively blended particles)
> 4. Integrate the particle system into your **existing Unity scene**.

> [!example] Example Effects
> 
> - Wisps of mist rising from the procedural artifact.
> - A void portal with swirling energy particles.
> - Sparks and dust emitted when an object is interacted with.

### Part 2: Adding Interactivity

> [!note] Key Steps for Part 2
> 
> 1. Use **C# scripting** to add **dynamic behavior** to your particle system.
> 2. Implement at least **one** of the following interactive mechanics:
>     - **Trigger-based Activation:** Particles appear when the player approaches.
>     - **Scripted Changes:** Adjust particle properties over time using C# (e.g., color shifts, intensity increases).
>     - **Physics Integration:** Particles that react to objects (collisions, forces).
> 3. Ensure that your effect is optimized and does not negatively impact performance.

## Deliverables

> [!todo] What to Submit
> 
> 1. **README File**
>     - A text or markdown file describing:
>         - The design and inspiration for your particle system.
>         - How interactivity was implemented with C#.
>         - Any challenges faced and solutions applied.
> 2. **Recorded Video (5–10 Minutes)**
>     - A **screen-recorded** walkthrough showcasing:
>         - The Unity scene with particle effects.
>         - Demonstration of the interactivity in action.
>         - Explanation of the design choices and implementation process.

> # Assignment 3: Effects and Particle Systems
> 
> ## Particle System Overview
> - Tool Used: Unity VFX Graph  
> - Effect: A swirling energy vortex emitting sparks and mist.  
> - Theme Connection: Represents a void artifact emitting unstable energy.
> 
> ## Interactive Elements
> - C# Script: Particles intensify when the player is near.  
> - Additional Behavior: Fog particles follow the player slightly for atmospheric immersion.
> 
> ## Challenges and Solutions
> - Issue: Particles were too performance-heavy.
> - Solution: Reduced spawn rate, optimized textures, and added LOD control.
