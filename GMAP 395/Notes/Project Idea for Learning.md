# **Interactive Environment with Procedural Artifact**

## **Project Overview**

### **Theme**

- A **mystical artifact** (e.g., a glowing, magical crystal or ancient device) set within an atmospheric environment.

### **Final Outcome**

- **Artifact:** Reacts dynamically to player interaction with visual and behavioral changes.
- **Environment:** Features atmospheric lighting, particle effects, and camera polish for a compelling experience.

## **Module Integration and Contributions**

### **Module 1: Procedural Modeling + Lighting Systems**

> [!info] Weeks 1-2: Laying the Foundation
> 
> - **Focus:** Students model the artifact procedurally and establish basic lighting.
> - **Key Deliverables:**
>     - A modular artifact base (e.g., crystal or mechanical structure).
>     - A simple environment with lighting systems to enhance its appearance.
> - **Example Features:**
>     - A pulsating glow effect using basic lighting techniques.

### **Module 2: Shaders and Material Development**

> [!info] Weeks 3-4: Adding Dynamics
> 
> - **Focus:** Develop shaders and materials to give the artifact dynamic visual behavior.
> - **Key Deliverables:**
>     - Custom shaders (e.g., glowing patterns, transparency effects).
>     - Integration of materials to simulate reactions like temperature changes or energy flows.
> - **Example Features:**
>     - A procedural shader to create shifting glow patterns or a "pulse" effect.

### **Module 3: Effects + Particle Systems**

> [!info] Weeks 5-6: Enhancing Interaction
> 
> - **Focus:** Implement particle systems and interactive effects.
> - **Key Deliverables:**
>     - Particle effects triggered by player actions (e.g., sparks, mist).
>     - Interactive features that enhance immersion.
> - **Example Features:**
>     - Particles emitting mist when the artifact is "activated" or approached.

### **Module 4: Camera Effects and Post-Processing**

> [!info] Week 7: Polishing the Scene
> 
> - **Focus:** Add camera and post-processing effects for a polished look.
> - **Key Deliverables:**
>     - Dynamic camera interactions (e.g., zoom, rotation).
>     - Post-processing effects like bloom, depth of field, and color grading.
> - **Example Features:**
>     - A cinematic camera movement when approaching the artifact.

## **Detailed Development Plan**

### **Week 1-2: Procedural Modeling + Lighting Systems**

1. **Artifact Base Creation:**
    - Students design a modular artifact in Unity.
    - Use primitive shapes and procedural modeling techniques.
2. **Environment Setup:**
    - Create a basic environment with placeholder assets.
3. **Lighting Integration:**
    - Add a directional light and experiment with spotlights or area lights.

### **Week 3-4: Shaders and Material Development**

1. **Custom Shader Design:**
    - Introduce Unity Shader Graph.
    - Create shaders with glow, transparency, or animated patterns.
2. **Material Application:**
    - Apply shaders to the artifact and refine their behavior.

### **Week 5-6: Effects + Particle Systems**

1. **Particle Effects Creation:**
    - Use Unity VFX Graph to create interactive particles (e.g., sparks, fog).
2. **Interaction Integration:**
    - Program triggers using Unity's event systems (e.g., OnTriggerEnter).

### **Week 7: Camera Effects and Post-Processing**

1. **Camera Behavior:**
    - Add Cinemachine for dynamic camera movements.
2. **Post-Processing Pipelines:**
    - Introduce Unity's Post-Processing Stack for bloom, depth of field, and color grading.
