## Quiz 2 - Game Lighting and Workflows

### Quiz: Game Lighting and Workflows

1. **Multiple Choice**  
    Which of the following is _not_ a purpose of game lighting?  
    a) Enhance mood and atmosphere  
    b) Communicate gameplay mechanics and objectives  
    c) Reduce memory usage in game engines  
    d) Guide the player’s attention
    
2. **True/False**  
    Emissive lighting involves objects emitting their own light, which can contribute to both real-time and baked lighting.
    
3. **Fill in the Blank**  
    _______ is a lighting technique that simulates realistic light interactions through bounces and contributes to an immersive environment.
    
4. **Multiple Choice**  
    What is the primary role of a **spotlight** in game lighting?  
    a) Provide uniform illumination across the scene  
    b) Illuminate a specific area with a cone-shaped beam  
    c) Simulate sunlight with infinite reach  
    d) Bounce light off surfaces for indirect lighting
    
5. **True/False**  
    Static lighting is best used for dynamic, constantly changing game environments.
    
6. **Fill in the Blank**  
    _______ lighting adjusts in real-time, making it ideal for interactive or changing environments.
    
7. **Multiple Choice**  
    Light probes are used in game development to:  
    a) Simulate detailed reflections for objects  
    b) Enhance lighting for static objects only  
    c) Improve the appearance of dynamic objects by capturing surrounding light  
    d) Automatically generate lighting settings for the entire scene
    
8. **Multiple Choice**  
    Which attribute of lighting involves ensuring that brightness levels fit the scene’s tone and function?  
    a) Quality  
    b) Quantity  
    c) Direction  
    d) Dynamics
    
9. **Multiple Choice**  
    Which type of lighting is best for creating soft, general illumination without a specific light source?
    a) Directional lighting  
	b) Ambient lighting  
	c) Spot lighting  
	d) Emissive lighting
	
1. **True/False**  
    Volumetric lighting is often used to add atmospheric depth to a game scene by simulating light scattering through particles like fog or dust.
