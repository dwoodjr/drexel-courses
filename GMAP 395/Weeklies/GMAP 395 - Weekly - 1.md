# Critique Brief: Project Vision & Preproduction Planning

> [!info] Overview 
> **Purpose:** Develop your quarter-long project concept through thematic exploration, skill goal-setting, and procedural thinking 
> **Format:** Individual presentation (3-4 minutes) + peer feedback**
> Due:** Week 2 class session

---

## Your Mission: Theme➡️Vision

This week's critique focuses on **preproduction planning** - *the critical thinking and research phase that sets up successful projects*. You'll present your initial project vision by connecting the course theme with your personal learning goals and procedural thinking approach.

---

## Part 1: Theme Interpretation & Visual Research

### Theme Interpretation Statement

**Write 2-3 sentences explaining your personal interpretation of the course theme.**

Consider questions like:

- What aspect of the theme interests you most?
- What mood or feeling do you want to convey through your work?
- How does the theme connect to your personal interests or artistic vision?

### Mood Board Creation (10+ References)

**Gather visual references that inspire your interpretation of the course theme.**

**Reference Categories to Consider:**
- **Games**: Environments, interfaces, characters that connect to the course theme
- **Film/TV**: Production design, visual effects, cinematography relevant to the theme
- **Architecture**: Design approaches that relate to thematic concepts
- **Technology**: Concept art, industrial design, interface design
- **Art/Design**: Any visual work that explores the course theme or related concepts

**Strategic Selection Criteria:**
- **Procedural Potential**: Look for elements that seem like they could be created through rules or algorithms
- **Modular Possibilities**: Identify systems that appear to be built from reusable components
- ***Technical Interest**: Choose references that connect to skills you want to develop*



---

## Part 2: Technical Skill Development Goals

### Personal Learning Objectives

**Identify 2-3 specific technical art skills you want to develop this quarter.**

**Skill Categories to Consider:**

- **Procedural Modeling**: Geometry nodes, algorithmic content creation, automated workflows
- **Lighting Systems**: Dynamic lighting, atmosphere creation, cinematic techniques
- **Shader Development**: Custom materials, interactive surfaces, visual effects
- **Particle Systems**: Environmental effects, interactive dynamics, performance optimization
- **Camera & Post-Processing**: Cinematic presentation, interactive cameras, visual polish

**For Each Skill Goal, Consider:**

- Why does this skill interest you?
- How does it connect to your theme interpretation?
- What specific aspect or technique do you want to explore?
- How might this skill appear in your final project?

---

## Part 3: Project Concept Development

### Initial Project Vision

**Based on your theme interpretation and skill goals, propose a preliminary project concept.**

**Consider the Final Project Requirements:**

- **Interactive Scene**: Unity-based experience showcasing your chosen module specialization
- **Module Focus**: Which of the four modules (Modeling+Lighting, Shaders, Effects, Camera) most interests you for deep exploration?
- **Integration**: How will all four modules work together in your scene?

**Project Scope Questions:**

- What type of environment, object, or experience do you want to create?
- How will players interact with your scene?
- What story or concept will your technical choices communicate?
- ***How ambitious is this vision for an 11-week timeline?***

---

## Part 4: Procedural Thinking Exercise

### Logic Flow Visualization

**Choose one aspect of your project concept and break it down into procedural steps.**

**Process:**

1. **Identify a System**: Pick one element that could benefit from procedural/algorithmic approaches (e.g., environment generation, material variation, particle behavior, camera movement)
    
2. **Map the Logic**: Write out the step-by-step process in "pseudocode" or simple logic:
    
    ```
    Example: Abandoned Tech Panel System
    - Start with: Base wall surface
    - Add: Grid of potential panel locations
    - Rule: 70% chance each location gets a panel
    - If panel: Choose from 3 panel types randomly
    - If damaged: Add rust/wear based on proximity to water sources
    - Add: Flickering lights with 30% failure rate
    ```
    
3. **Consider Interactions**: How might player interaction or environmental changes affect this system?
    

**Alternative Examples:**

- **Material Aging**: How surfaces change over time based on use patterns
- **Lighting Transitions**: Rules for day/night cycles or mood changes
- **Particle Responses**: How effects react to player presence or environmental triggers
- **Camera Behavior**: Logic for focusing on points of interest or following player actions

## Presentation Format

### Individual Presentation

**Present your preproduction research covering:**

1. **Theme Interpretation**
    - Show 3-4 key mood board references
    - Explain your personal interpretation of the course theme
2. **Skill Goals**
