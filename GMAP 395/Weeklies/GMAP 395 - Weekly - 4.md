# Week 4 Progress Check: Lighting & Shader Research

> [!info] Overview 
> **Purpose:** Share your Unity lighting setup and initial shader research/experimentation  
> **Format:** Brief individual share (2-3 minutes) + peer feedback online  
> **Due:** Thread Week 4 class session - Feedback Week 4 EOW

---

## Your Mission:

Time to show us how your asset is looking in Unity and what direction you're heading with shaders! This week we want to see your **lighting setup in action** and your **research into shader possibilities** for your final project.

---

## What to Share

### 🎮 Unity Lighting Screenshot (1 image)

**Capture your asset properly lit in Unity:**

- Your procedural asset from Module 1 in a Unity scene
- Show off your lighting setup (directional light, point lights, etc.)

### 🔍 Shader Research & Exploration (2-3 images)

**Show us your shader direction through:**

**Option A: Reference Research**

- Screenshots of shaders/materials that inspire your final vision
- Examples from games, tutorials, or art that match your aesthetic goals
- Annotate what specifically appeals to you about each example

**Option B: Initial Shader Graph Attempts**

- Screenshots of simple shader graph experiments you've tried
- Basic node setups, even if they're not working perfectly yet
- Show your thought process through the node network

**Option C: Combination of Both**

- Mix of reference images and your early attempts to recreate them
- Side-by-side comparisons of inspiration vs. your results

### 📝 Shader Direction Statement (2-3 sentences)

**Tell us your shader game plan:**

- What type of shader are you aiming for? (water, dissolve, foliage, metal, glass, etc.)
- How will this shader enhance your asset's visual impact?
- What's one specific effect or property you want to achieve?

---

## Presentation Format

### Individual Share (2-3 minutes)

- **Show your Unity lighting** - walk us through your scene setup
- **Present your shader research** - explain what you're aiming for
- **Connect the vision** - how will the shader enhance your lit asset?
- **Share one discovery** - what did you learn from your research/attempts?

### Peer Feedback & Discussion (3+ peers)

**Quick responses to/from classmates:**

- What lighting techniques are working well in their scene?
- Any shader references or approaches that could benefit your own project?
- Suggestions for shader tutorials or techniques to explore?

>[!warning] Remember to use the [[Six Thinking Hats Giving Good Game Design Feedback|Six Hats Method]] for meaningful and actionable feedback.

## Submission

### For Class

- **Screenshots ready to share** (uploaded to thread to present)
- **Brief talking points** prepared about your shader direction

### For Blackboard

- **Post your Unity lighting screenshot** in your individual thread
- **Include your 2-3 shader research/attempt images**
- **Add your shader direction statement**
- **Comment on 2-3 peer posts** with feedback or suggestions

> [!tip] 💡 Remember
> 
> - **Research counts** - even if you haven't made a shader yet, good reference research is valuable
> - **Document your process** - show us failed attempts, they help us understand your thinking
> - **Be specific about goals** - "I want a cool water shader" vs. "I want an animated water shader with foam edges and depth-based transparency"
> - **Lighting matters** - a well-lit basic material often looks better than a poorly-lit complex shader

> [!warning] 🎯 Looking Ahead 
> Next week (Crit 5) you'll need to show your actual shader creation and application to your asset, so use this week to solidify your direction!
