# Week 5 Progress Check: Shader Creation & Material Application

> [!info] Overview 
> **Purpose:** Demonstrate your custom shader development and material application to your asset  
> **Format:** Brief individual share (3-4 minutes) + peer feedback online  
> **Due:** Week 5 class session - Feedback by EOW

---

## Your Mission:

Time to put your shader research into practice! This week we want to see your **actual shader creation** in Shader Graph and how it looks when **applied to your asset** through materials. Show us both your successes and your problem-solving process.

---

## What to Share

### 🎨 Shader Development Progress (2-3 images)

**Document your shader creation journey:**

**Required Screenshots:**

1. **Your Shader Graph network** - Show us the node setup you've created
2. **Material applied to your asset** - Your shader/material on your procedural model in Unity
3. **Shader effect in action** - Demonstrate any animated or interactive properties (if present at this time)

### 🛠️ Development Process Explanation

**Briefly describe your shader development experience:**

**What You Attempted:**

- What type of shader did you set out to create?
- What specific visual effects or properties were you aiming for?
- Which tutorials, references, or techniques did you follow?

**What's Working:**

- Which aspects of your shader are successful?
- What effects or properties turned out better than expected?
- Any happy accidents or discoveries along the way?

**Challenges Faced:**

- What technical problems did you encounter?
- Which nodes or concepts were most difficult to understand?
- Any performance issues or unexpected behaviors?

**Solutions & Workarounds:**

- How did you solve (or attempt to solve) problems?
- What resources helped you troubleshoot issues?
- Any compromises you made to achieve your vision?

## Presentation Format

### Individual Share (3-4 minutes)

- **Show your shader graph** - walk us through your node network and logic
- **Demonstrate on your asset** - how does the material look applied to your model?
- **Explain your process** - what you attempted, what worked, what challenged you
- **Share solutions** - how you overcame obstacles or what you're still working on

### Peer Feedback & Discussion (3+ peers)

**Constructive feedback focus:**

- Technical suggestions for node improvements or optimizations
- Visual feedback on the shader's aesthetic effectiveness
- Troubleshooting ideas for ongoing challenges
- Inspiration from successful techniques demonstrated by others

>[!warning] Remember to use the [[Six Thinking Hats Giving Good Game Design Feedback|Six Hats Method]] for meaningful and actionable feedback.

## Submission

### For Class

- **Screenshots ready to share** (uploaded to thread to present)
- **Brief notes** prepared about your process and challenges

### For Blackboard

- **Post your 2-3 shader development screenshots** in your individual thread
- **Include your process explanation** (what you attempted, what works, challenges, solutions)
- **Respond to 2-3 peer posts** with technical suggestions or encouragement

> [!success] 🎯 Evaluation Focus
> 
> **This week we're looking for:**
> 
> - **Experimentation** - Evidence that you've actively worked with Shader Graph
> - **Problem-solving** - How you approach and work through technical challenges
> - **Application** - Successfully applying your shader to your asset via materials
> - **Reflection** - Understanding of what works, what doesn't, and why

> [!tip] 💡 Remember
> 
> - **Progress over perfection** - A simple working shader is better than a complex broken one
> - **Document failures** - Show us what didn't work, it helps everyone learn
> - **Materials matter** - Proper material setup is crucial for shader application
> - **Performance awareness** - Consider how complex your shader is for real-time rendering

> [!note] 🔄 Iteration Mindset 
> **Your shader doesn't need to be final!** This is about demonstrating your learning process and getting feedback for further refinement toward your final project.
