# Week 3 Progress Check: Procedural Modeling Exploration

> [!info] Overview 
> **Purpose:** Share your early procedural modeling experiments and current project direction  
> **Format:** Brief individual share (2-3 minutes) + peer feedback  online
> **Due:** Week 3 class session

---

## Your Mission:

This week is all about **showing your work** - we want to see what you've been experimenting with in your procedural modeling explorations and how your project concept is evolving through some hands-on practice.

---

## What to Share

### Progress Screenshots (3-5 images)

**Capture your work-in-progress from your DCC (Blender, Maya, Houdini, etc.)**
Some ideas of things to share:
- **Node networks/graphs** - Show us your procedural setup
- **Geometry results** - What's your system generating?
- **Iterations/variations** - Different outcomes from tweaking parameters
- **Problem areas** - Things that aren't working yet (this is valuable too!)

### Brief Project Update (2-3 sentences)

**Tell us where you're at with your project concept:**

- What procedural modeling(s) technique are you exploring?
- How does this connect to your original project vision? If its different/changes, how so ?
- What's one thing you've discovered or learned that surprised you?
- What's your next step or biggest current challenge?

---

## Presentation Format

### Individual Share (2-3 minutes)

- **Show your screenshots** - walk us through what we're seeing
- **Explain your process** - what procedural approach are you using?
- **Connect to your project** - how does this fit your bigger vision?
- **Share one challenge** - what's not working or what do you need help with?

### Peer Feedback & Discussion (3+ peers)

**Quick responses to/from classmates:**

- What do you find most interesting about this approach?
- Any suggestions for troubleshooting or next steps?
- How might this technique apply to other projects?

## Submission

### For Class

- **Screenshots ready to share** (uploaded to thread to present)
- **Brief talking points** prepared

### For Blackboard

- **Post your screenshots** in your individual thread
- **Include your 2-3 sentence project update**
- **Comment on 2-3 peer posts** with encouragement or suggestions

> [!tip] Remember
> 
> - **Progress > perfection** - we want to see your learning process
> - **Problems are valuable** - share what's not working, we can help troubleshoot
> - **Be specific** - instead of "I'm making a building," try "I'm trying to use arrays/modifiers to create modular wall panels"
