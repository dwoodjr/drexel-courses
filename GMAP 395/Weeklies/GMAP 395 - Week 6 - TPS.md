# VFX Graph Think-Pair-Share Activity

## 🎯 Activity Overview + Learning Outcomes

**Duration:** ~50 minutes  
**Format:** Exploratory **Thinking** → **Pair** Discussion → Class **Sharing**  
**Goal:** Understand VFX Graph nodes through hands-on experimentation
Students will:
- Gain hands-on VFX Graph experience
- Understand node-based thinking
- Practice explaining technical concepts
- See multiple approaches to same tools
- Build confidence through experimentation


---

## 📦 Starter VFX

Create a default VFX Graph in Unity.
Right-Click (Project Window) > Create > Visual Effects > VFX Graph
Give it a useful name.

**Base Graph Components:**

- Spawn Rate (Constant)
- Set Velocity (Random)
- Set Lifetime (Random)
- Orient (Face Camera Plane)
- Set Size (Over Lifetime)
- Set Color (Over Lifetime)

---

## 🔍 Think Phase (10 minutes)

**Thinking + Exploration**

Based on your assigned Node Focus Card (below), investigate the nodes listed. 
**Hint**: The internet has a ton of information; including [Unity's VFX Graph Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.visualeffectgraph@14.0/manual/index.html)

### Node Focus Groups:

>[!Note] **1 - Movement Nodes**
>Add Velocity (Random)
>Turbulence
>  Gravity

> [!example] **2 - Visual Nodes**
> Set Color (Over Lifetime)
> Set Alpha (Over Lifetime)
> Set Size (Random)

>[!warning] **3 - Emission Nodes** 
>Spawn Rate (Constant) 
>Spawn Rate (Variable) 
>Burst (Periodic)

>[!error] **4 - Shape Nodes** 
>Set Position Shape (Sphere) 
>Set Position Shape (Box) 
>Set Position Shape (Circle)

### Think Task:
- Add assigned nodes to the base graph
- Experiment with different values
- Note what each parameter does
- Take screenshots of interesting results

---

## 👥 Pair Phase (15 minutes)

### Pair Tasks:
1. **Compare discoveries** - What did each person in the group find?
2. **Test combinations** - Try nodes together
3. **Create variations** - Make 2-3 different "looks"
4. **Prepare explanation** - How would you teach these nodes?

### Guiding Questions:
- What does each parameter control?
- What happens at extreme values?
- How do these nodes work together?
- What visual styles can you create?

---

## 🗣️ Share Phase (20 minutes)

### Presentation Format:

1. **Show before/after** (base graph vs. modified)
2. **Demonstrate key parameters** (manipulation results)
3. **Explain one major ("wow") discovery**
4. **Share one challenge/confusion**

---

## 📝 Wrap-up Reflection (5 minutes)

**Quick write:**
- One thing that surprised you
- One node you want to explore more
- One question you still have

>[!Summary] Submission
>Submission of your groups materials, finding, and reflections should be submitted on BB Learn by END OF CLASS
>This can be simple, in the form of a word doc, pdf, or slides.
