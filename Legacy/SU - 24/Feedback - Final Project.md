Good:
- great modular creation system
- visually consistent style
Bad:
- while great use of modularity/procedural, there is less real-time control of the modular system although you do have some "game-based" simulated interaction
- You benefit from some more interesting lighting, like a "night time driving mode" Maybe some reflectivity shader for headlight in license plates.

The development process for my Punch Buddy demo was definitely a rocky one. Therewere many hiccups because what I wanted to accomplish required intricate knowledge ofUnity’s inner workings, which I didn’t quite have. I was dead set on making what I wantedto work, work, and by the end I had to let my perfectionism slide and supply a functionalproduct, not an entirely pretty one.I am very proud of what I was able to accomplish. I worked previously with ScriptableObjects but never my own, so the last quarter and this one really helped me gainknowledge on it to the point where I feel extremely experienced now. This was my firsttime working with the UI Builder, and while it has its kinks and I still was unable to make it‘interactive’ so that certain variables only showed after a button was toggled, the fact thatit works in its entirety is a miracle to me.I worked on Punch Buddy in binge sessions. It wasn’t the kind of project where I could sitdown for a half hour or hour and chip away at it. The solutions to any problems wouldalways come at night, so I would awaken the next day and work as long as I could to see ifmy solution worked. That’s how I managed to create the looping dizzy animation, which Ionly used a tutorial to view how loading ring VFX worked.Thankfully, I had already programmed or made a lot of what was required for the previouscourse I built this in. However, that was a full game and this was a small scene solelyfocused on the license plate mechanic, which while developed, was a MESS of code. Itneeded to be changed into something modular, instead of the original 50 statesgeneration. There’s still changes that need to be made, so that the UI has the toon shaderworking as well (I need to have the code switch a material texture instead of the image).The only other goal I had hoped to achieve, but will have to be done at a later date, is tohave a license plate editor in game. Now that the backend is working, all that will beneeded to do is hook up a scene and UI so that plates can be made and then added topacks, which the player can then choose to load up when they play.

Feedback:

Good work on completing your final project. You've shown a solid grasp of the majority of course concepts.

Highlights:
- Great modular creation system
- Visually consistent style

Areas to work on:
- Add more real-time control to your modular system during game play, you could easily convey some of the editor functions to in-game "player creation" like features.
- Enhance lighting (e.g., "night time driving mode"). Try adding a reflectivity shader for headlights on license plates in this mode. Could be cool to see.

Your postmortem shows you tackled some tough challenges. Nice job figuring out ScriptableObjects and the UI Builder. Your problem-solving approach, while leading to some late nights, paid off well it seems.

For future projects, focus on making your code more modular (if you need to tackle coding yourself). Look into SOLID principles for guidance on improving code structure. This will help with maintenance and adding new features, like your planned license plate editor.

Keep pushing yourself and exploring new techniques. You're on the right track. And congratulations on graduating!

The entire development process of not only this game but all of my other assignments in this class as a result of what I learned was academically successful in a personal way. I personally learned new things and new ways of Unity that I can genuinely see myself using in my future games. I did not get to implement everything that I intended to into my game, including preexisting things that I had present in my other assignments that I just couldn’t successfully transfer over, but it was still overall an interesting learning experience. I really liked how I was able to express my own creativity in the form of a 3D video game environment because so far, I have not been able to do that in any of my classes at Drexel. I’ve found from working on my project that I’m most attracted to creating and designing video game environments a bit more than the coding and technical aspects.All of the things I wanted to implement into my game where completely doable and I do believe I had the correct resources to do it that I didn’t need to go out and teach myself on, at least not too much. I wanted to implement phantom shadows in my game that appeared when
certain events were triggered but that was something that wasn’t taught in this class and I didn’t already know how to do. Luckily, I feel like learning how to do something like that is within range of my knowledge if I really put the effort into it. I had a video game in mind and even though I did not complete it, I completed enough to be confident enough to continue it beyond this class.One success that I achieved from this project was creating my own shaders in their own environment! I really liked learning how to do that because it’s such an artsy thing for Unity to have in my opinion. I also liked creating my own tree assets for my environment. I had no idea Unity had its own tree-asset maker with its own settings. On the other hand, one challenge I ran into was time management. I did not set enough time aside to this project to get as much done as I wanted to in the allotted time which is unfortunate because I really had a great vision for this project. That directly relates to my learning outcome, which is that I need to learn to not be afraid of making mistakes when learning something new.As for the assets I used, I got my building asset from here and my character asset from here.The most important thing for this postmortem is highlighting my revised game pitch. I find that my game is less of a “game” but more of an experience. The player controls a character in the grass clearing of a forest that contains a building that you can explore with experimental shaders and lighting complimenting the area.

Bashira,
Nice job on completing your final project. You've met a good few of the project requirements and demonstrated a well-planned, cohesive concept with interesting narrative design elements. Your postmortem reflects good personal growth and learning, particularly in discovering a passion for environment design. The initiative shows in creating custom tree assets.

Moving forward, focus on improving visual cohesion across your project, fully implementing planned elements in steps, like shaders or completing the procedural placement system for objects. Also, work on refining lighting for better atmosphere.  For future projects, work on time management to fully realize your vision, don't hesitate to experiment, and continue building your environment design skills. Consider exploring other environment design software like Gaia or Houdini for procedural realistic terrain generation. Also Unity has some interesting and pretty approachable terrain scattering tools as well. Keep refining your skills and building on this progress.

I felt like my game was very successful in my eyes for the short amount of time itwas created in. This gave me the experience of coding for different game types, in thiscase a city builder that uses mouse controls. This game also gave me whole newexperiences with UI. Learning to work with procedurally generated elements was also anew learning experience for me. Procedurally generated land created a lot of issues andlearning curves I had not dealt with before.A big success for me in the game was my ability to create a type of gamedifferent than any I have done before. All my other games have been platformers or firstperson shooters so I feel like trying something new and creating this city builder themewas a big success for me. My biggest challenge was working with the UI, I haven’t donemany games with interactable UI and it was definitely a big struggle for me but I feel likeI learned enough about it to do it better next time. A new learning outcome for me waslearning to place items where your mouse is clicking, getting this to work gave me a lotof issues but is a main feature of my game. own Builder is an interactive, environment based experience that allows the player tobuild their own town. Using procedural generation the player will be put into a worldcreated just for them to start being their town in. Then using modular modeling playerswill be able to place roads and buildings to create a thriving town.With this creation each player can create their own town, that they can have run howthey like, making them the mayor of the town. Players will get to place their ownbuildings and create the town they want.
