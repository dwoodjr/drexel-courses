Subject: Week 10 (Final Class) - Game Audio Wrap-Up & Final Project Drafts

Hello Students!

As we approach our final week of class, I wanted to give you a heads-up on what to expect for Week 10:
1. Short Lecture & Demo (First Hour):
   - We'll wrap up our game audio module with a brief lecture.
   - This will be followed by a short demo to reinforce key concepts.
2. As always, we will have a short break after the lecture + demo.
3. Final Project Draft Presentations (Remaining Time):
   - Each student will present their project progress.
   - Presentations should be 5-7 minutes long (absolutely no longer).
   - Your presentation should:
     a) Showcase all project progress to date
     b) Highlight which final project requirements have been met
     c) Outline which requirements will be completed by the end of the finals week due date

In terms of the presentation format, follow these guidelines:
- You can use visual aids (slides, videos, etc.). Create a more static and polished visual presentation.
  OR
- Demonstrate your Unity project in real-time. Just open up Unity and talk us through your work.

Some important notes:
- Presenting, or not presenting, your draft impact your final project grade.
- This is your chance to get valuable feedback before the final submission. Come prepared to share your work and discuss any challenges you're facing.

Looking forward to seeing your projects!

Best,
Darren
