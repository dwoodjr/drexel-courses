# Final - Game Art Conceptualization

## Summary
In this assignment, you will create a conceptual pitch document for your final game art production project. This project will be an individual effort to create a short, original interactive game art experience that showcases your skills in procedural workflows, custom shaders, visual effects, game audio implementation, and game lighting. Your concept should outline a cohesive vision for a prop, character, or environment-focused experience that will incorporate elements from each module of the course.

## Requirements
1. Choose one of the following focus areas for your project:
   - Prop-focused experience
   - Character-focused experience
   - Environment-focused experience

2. Your concept must incorporate procedural workflows and elements from each course module:
   - Procedural + Modular Modeling and Workflows
   - Material + Shader Development
   - Image + Particle Effects
   - Lighting + Camera Effects
   - Game Audio and Implementation

3. The final project must be (minimally) interactive and showcase your custom-built elements in a meaningful way.

4. While you may use existing assets for supporting elements, all VFX, shaders, and materials must be original creations.

5. Your concept should consider how the interactive element will allow users to experience and appreciate your work in a simulated game setting.

## Deliverables
A pitch document (PDF format) that includes:
   - Project title and brief tagline
   - Concept overview (100-300 words)
   - Visual target: Include mood boards, style references, or concept sketches
   - Technical breakdown: List the key technical features you plan to implement
   - Interactivity description: Explain how users will interact with your creation
   - Production pipeline: Outline your planned workflow and tools

| C        | Concept meets basic requirements but lacks depth or innovation. Technical elements are present but not well-integrated. Interactivity is basic.                                                                              |
| B- to B+ | Solid concept with clear vision. Most technical elements are well-thought-out and integrated. Interactivity is meaningful. Some innovative ideas present.                                                                    |
| A- to A+ | Exceptional concept with a cohesive, innovative vision. All technical elements are well-integrated and show potential for impressive execution. Interactivity is engaging and showcases the procedural elements effectively. |

Additional factors that can influence your grade within these ranges include:
- Creativity and originality of the concept
- Clarity and professionalism of the pitch document
- Feasibility of the project within the course timeframe
- Depth of understanding demonstrated for each technical element
- Quality and relevance of visual references and mood boards

# Example Pitch Document

# Lightsaber Forge: Craft Your Destiny

## Concept Overview

"Lightsaber Forge" is an interactive, prop-focused experience that puts players in the role of a Jedi weaponsmith. Using procedural generation techniques, players will craft unique lightsabers by choosing and manipulating lightsaber components, such as energy crystals, activation switches, and blade guards.

With this procedural system each lightsaber creation will reflect the choices and personality of its crafter. Once forged, players can test their lightsaber by igniting the blade and swinging it around, experiencing the weight, balance, and energy signature of their unique weapon.

## Visual Target

Show, don't tell for this section, images and video links are far better than words here.

## Technical Breakdown

1. Procedural Modeling System:
   - Generate unique lightsaber components
   - Implement a modular assembly system for seamless component integration

2. Custom Shader Development:
   - Create an "energy flow" shader for lightsaber blades with customizable properties
   - Develop a "holographic interface" shader for the forge's control panels

3. Particle and VFX System:
   - Design a dynamic spark and energy particle system for the forging process
   - Implement a blade ignition effect with procedurally generated plasma tendrils

4. Lighting and Camera Effects:
   - Create a reactive lighting system that responds to lightsaber properties
   - Implement a zoom camera effect for focusing on details

5. Procedural Audio Generation:
   - Develop a system for generating unique lightsaber hum and swing sounds based on the saber's properties
   - Create an ambient audio system for the forge environment

## Interactivity Description

Players will interact with the forge through a combination of gesture-based controls and UI interfaces. The forging process will be divided into stages:

1. Crystal Selection: Choose and manipulate the core crystal, setting the base properties of the lightsaber.
2. Assembly: Combine components in a 3D space, with real-time feedback on balance and power.
3. Tuning: Fine-tune the lightsaber's energy flow and blade properties using UI controls.
4. Testing: Enter a training arena to test the lightsaber's feel and performance.

## Production Pipeline

1. Concept and Design: Finalize the visual style and user interface layout
2. Procedural Systems Development: Create the core generation systems for components and effects
3. Shader and VFX Creation: Develop custom shaders and particle systems
4. 3D Asset Creation: Design base assets for procedural modification
5. UI Implementation: Develop the holographic interface system (UI + shader)
6. Audio System: Implement procedural audio generation and ambient sound design
7. Integration and Testing: Combine all elements and refine the user experience
8. Polish and Optimization: Fine-tune performance and visual fidelity
