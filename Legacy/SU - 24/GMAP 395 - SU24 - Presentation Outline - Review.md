# Game Design Foundations: A Quick Review

---

## What is Game Design?

"Game Design is the process of building, or designing, an experience that encompasses a system meant to provide structured play that fulfills a basic human need."

---

## The Iterative Game Design Process

1. Conceptualize
2. Prototype
3. Playtest
4. Evaluate

---

## Conceptualize

- Generate and refine ideas
- Define core mechanics and themes
- Consider target audience and platform
- Use reference and inspiration

---

## Prototype

- Create a playable version of your concept
- Focus on core mechanics and basic functionality
- Use rapid prototyping techniques (paper, digital tools)
- Aim for "low cost" versions to test ideas quickly

---

## Playtest

- Test your game with various players
- Gather feedback on gameplay, difficulty, and enjoyment
- Observe player behavior and reactions
- Document findings and insights

---

## Evaluate

- Analyze playtest results and feedback
- Identify strengths and weaknesses in your design
- Brainstorm solutions to problems
- Plan next steps for iteration

---

## The Importance of Iteration

- Refine and improve your game through multiple cycles
- Each iteration brings you closer to your design goals
- Embrace failure as a learning opportunity
- Remember: great games are made, not born

---

## MDA Framework

- Mechanics
- Dynamics
- Aesthetics

---

## Mechanics

- The rules and procedures of the game
- What players can do and how they interact
- Examples: movement, resource management, combat systems

---

## Dynamics

- The behavior that emerges from player interactions with mechanics
- How the game feels in motion
- Examples: tension in a stealth game, resource scarcity in survival games

---

## Aesthetics

- The emotional responses evoked in the player
- The desired player experience
- Examples: sense of discovery, feelings of accomplishment, social connection

---

## DDE Framework

- Design
- Dynamics
- Experience

---

## Design

- The blueprint or structure of the game
- Includes mechanics, game code, and interface
- How the game world is presented through content

---

## Dynamics

- Player-Game interactions
- Player-Player interactions
- Game-Game interactions (e.g., AI behaviors)

---

## Experience

- Sensory aspects (sight, sound, etc.)
- Emotional responses
- Psychological engagement (challenge, discovery, expression)

---

## Understanding Play

"A series of activities undertaken for enjoyment/entertainment that fulfill intrinsic needs or goals."

---

## Characteristics of Play

- Voluntary and intrinsically motivated
- Actively engaging
- Often imaginative or make-believe
- Occurs within set boundaries (rules, time, space)

---

## Play vs. Gameplay

- Play: General activities for enjoyment
- Gameplay: Play that arises from the rules/system of a game

---

## Intrinsic Motivations in Play

1. Autonomy: Sense of control and choice
2. Competence: Feeling of mastery and achievement
3. Relatedness: Connection to others or the game world

---

## Designing for Play

- Create opportunities for meaningful choices
- Balance challenge with achievability
- Foster social connections or deep world engagement
- Allow for experimentation and creativity within the game's rules

---

## Tying It All Together

- Game design is an iterative process of creating structured play experiences
- MDA and DDE frameworks help analyze and refine game designs
- Understanding play is crucial for creating engaging and meaningful games
