Dear Students,

I've completed grading all submitted assignments to date and have entered zeros for missing and late work (excluding the Final Project). This provides you with the most accurate current grade possible.

Please note:
- Grades can still change if you submit work related to missing assignments by September 8, 5:00 AM.
	- Submissions must be tangentially related to the assignment details (e.g., video, project files, etc.). But get something in.
- Some credit will be given for late submissions received before this deadline.
	- Prioritize Assignments (1 - 4) and the Final Project over progress reports, they are worth significantly more.
- Any work submitted after September 8, 5:00 AM will remain a zero.
	- This deadline is absolute and cannot be extended due to strict university final grade submission policies.
- The Final Project is not subject to this deadline. The due date posted on Blackboard Learn for the Final Project remains.
	- Any project submitted after its specific due date will be considered late and is subject to late penalties.

Check your current grades and take advantage of this opportunity to improve your standing before the quarter ends.

Regards,
Darren
