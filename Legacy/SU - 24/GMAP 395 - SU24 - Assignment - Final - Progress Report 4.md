# Final - Project Progress Report - Lighting, Camera Effects, and Audio Implementation

## Objective
Provide a comprehensive update on your progress for the Lighting, Camera Effects, Post-Processing, and Audio Implementation *(if you are at a good point for this*) components of your final project. This assignment will help you showcase your development so far and identify any challenges you're facing in creating an immersive audiovisual experience for your game artifact.

## Requirements
1. Create a short video presentation (maximum 5 minutes) that covers:
   - Your progress on Lighting and Visual Effects, including:

      - Any dynamic audio systems you've been developing (e.g., adaptive music, procedural audio)
   - Demonstration of your current work-in-progress, showing the lighting, effects, and audio in action
   - Any questions or development roadblocks you're experiencing

2. Submit a short written summary (150-300 words) of your progress, challenges, and questions related to lighting, camera effects, post-processing, and audio implementation
