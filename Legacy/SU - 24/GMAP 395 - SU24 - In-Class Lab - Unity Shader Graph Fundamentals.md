## Lab: Unity Shader Graph Fundamentals

### Objective

Learn to create and modify shaders using Unity's Shader Graph, focusing on visual programming concepts.

### Part 1: Creating a Basic PBR Shader (30 minutes)

1. Set up a new Shader Graph in Unity
2. Create inputs for Albedo, Metallic, and Smoothness
3. Connect these properties to the PBR Master node
4. Apply the shader to a 3D object and test different values

### Part 2: Implementing Normal Mapping (30 minutes)

1. Add a normal map input to your Shader Graph
2. Set up the necessary nodes to apply the normal map
3. Test the normal map effect on various 3D models

### Part 3: Creating a Dissolve Effect (40 minutes)

1. Set up a noise texture input
2. Create a dissolve effect using the noise texture and a threshold value
3. Add edge glow to the dissolve effect
4. Implement controls for dissolve amount and edge color/thickness

### Challenge: Vertex Animation (20 minutes)

Use Shader Graph to create a vertex animation effect (e.g., flag waving, foliage movement) without writing any code.

## Lab Submission Guidelines

For each lab:

1. Save your shader files (Week 1) or Shader Graph assets (Week 2)
2. Create a simple scene demonstrating each part of the lab
3. Write a brief (200-300 word) reflection on what you learned and any challenges you faced
4. Submit your project files and reflection document
