# VFX Development

## Objective
Develop one unique visual effect using either VFX Graph or the Particle System, and integrate it into a real-time game scenario using C# scripting. This assignment will help you make progress towards your final project's VFX requirements.

## Final Project VFX Requirements Reminder
For your final project, you will need to develop a total of 3 unique visual effects:
- Effects must use VFX Graph or Particle System

All effects should be meaningfully integrated into your game scene.

## Assignment Requirements

### 1. VFX Development:
Create one visual effect using either VFX Graph or the Particle System. Your effect should incorporate at least two of the following techniques:

1. Particle emission based on game events or player actions
2. Color changes over the lifetime of the effect
3. Size or scale variations of particles
4. Velocity or directional control of particles
5. Texture animation or sprite sheet animation
6. Use of 3D meshes as particles
7. Integration with lighting (e.g. emissive particles)
8. Collision interactions

> üí° **Tip:** You can use techniques from our in-class labs as a starting point, but try to customize and expand upon them.

### 2. C# Integration:
Develop a C# script that controls your visual effect in real-time, similar to what was demonstrated in class. Your script should:

- Trigger or modify the effect based on a game scenario (e.g., player action, game event, or environmental change)
- Control at least one parameter of the effect (e.g., emission rate, particle size, or color)

> üîç **Example:** If you've created a fire effect, your C# script could increase its intensity when the player approaches, or change its color based on the time of day in your game.

### 3. Demo Scene:
Create a simple demo scene that showcases your visual effect in action. This scene should:

- Demonstrate the integration of your effect with the game scenario
- Allow for real-time interaction or observation of the effect's behavior

### 4. Documentation:
Provide a brief (1/2 - 1 page) technical write-up explaining:
- The functionality and purpose of your visual effect
- How the C# script interacts with and controls the effect
- How this effect contributes to your overall game concept
- Your plans for the remaining two effects required for your final project

> üìù **Hint:** Include screenshots or a GIF to showcase your effect in action.

## Deliverables
1. Unity project folders (**ASSETS, PACKAGES, PROJECT SETTINGS**) zipped:
   - Your VFX Graph or Particle System file
   - C# script for VFX control
   - Demo scene showcasing your integrated VFX
   - Any necessary textures or additional assets
2. Technical write-up (PDF/DOCX format)
3. Short video (1 - 2 minutes) demonstrating your visual effect in the context of your demo scene

## Evaluation Criteria
- VFX Implementation and Visual Appeal
- C# Integration and Real-time Control
- Relevance to Game Concept
- Documentation and Presentation

## Tips for Success
- Start with a clear idea of how this effect fits into your overall game concept.
- Test your effect in different scenarios to ensure it works well in various situations.
- Don't hesitate to reach out for clarification or guidance.
- Remember, this is a stepping stone towards your final project. Use this opportunity to get feedback and refine your VFX skills!
