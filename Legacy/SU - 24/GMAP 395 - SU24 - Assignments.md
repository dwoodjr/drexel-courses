# Final - Game Art Conceptualization

## Summary
In this assignment, you will create a conceptual pitch document for your final game art production project. This project will be an individual effort to create a short, original interactive game art experience that showcases your skills in procedural workflows, custom shaders, image effects, and potentially procedural animation. Your concept should outline a cohesive vision for a prop, character, or environment-focused experience that will incorporate elements from each module of the course.

## Requirements
1. Choose one of the following focus areas for your project:
   - Prop-focused experience
   - Character-focused experience
   - Environment-focused experience

2. Your concept must incorporate procedural workflows and elements from each course module:
   - Procedural + Modular Modeling and Workflows
   - Material + Shader Development
   - Image + Particle Effects
   - Lighting + Camera Effects
   - Game Audio and Implementation

3. The final project must be interactive and showcase your custom-built elements in a meaningful way.

4. While you may use existing assets for supporting elements, all VFX, shaders, and materials must be original creations.

5. Your concept should consider how the interactive element will allow users to experience and appreciate your procedural work.

## Deliverables
1. A pitch document (PDF format) that includes:
   - Project title and brief tagline
   - Concept overview (200-300 words)
   - Visual target: Include mood boards, style references, or concept sketches
   - Technical breakdown: List the key technical features you plan to implement
   - Interactivity description: Explain how users will interact with your creation
   - Production pipeline: Outline your planned workflow and tools
   - Challenges and solutions: Identify potential technical challenges and your approach to solving them

## Rubric

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| C     | Concept meets basic requirements but lacks depth or innovation. Technical elements are present but not well-integrated. Interactivity is basic. |
| B- to B+ | Solid concept with clear vision. Most technical elements are well-thought-out and integrated. Interactivity is meaningful. Some innovative ideas present. |
| A- to A+ | Exceptional concept with a cohesive, innovative vision. All technical elements are well-integrated and show potential for impressive execution. Interactivity is engaging and showcases the procedural elements effectively. |

Additional factors that can influence your grade within these ranges include:
- Creativity and originality of the concept
- Clarity and professionalism of the pitch document
- Feasibility of the project within the course timeframe
- Depth of understanding demonstrated for each technical element
- Quality and relevance of visual references and mood boards
- Thoughtfulness in addressing potential challenges


# Lightsaber Builder Tutorial + Procedural Game Art

### Summary
In this assignment, you will follow the provided tutorial to create a Lightsaber Builder system in Unity. After completing the base tutorial, you will choose one of the provided challenges to enhance your system, demonstrating your understanding of procedural workflows and game design principles.
