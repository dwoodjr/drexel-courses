Slide 5: Game Feel and VFX

Content:
- How VFX contribute to Game Feel
- Quote: "Game Feel is the tactile sensation of manipulating a digital agent." - Steve Swink

Speaker Notes:
Game Feel, a concept popularized by Steve Swink, refers to the moment-to-moment sensation of controlling a game. VFX are a key component in creating satisfying game feel, providing visual reinforcement to player actions and game events.

Slide 7: Proceduralism in VFX

Content:
- Definition: Using algorithms to generate VFX content
- Benefits:
  - Efficiency in content creation
  - Runtime variety
  - Adaptability to different scenarios

Speaker Notes:
Proceduralism in VFX refers to using algorithms and rules to generate effect content, rather than manually creating every aspect. This approach offers efficiency in content creation, allows for greater runtime variety, and enables effects to adapt to different in-game scenarios.

- Supports physics interactions

Speaker Notes:
Unity's Particle System is a built-in feature that's been a staple of VFX creation in Unity for years. It's a CPU-based system capable of simulating thousands of particles and supports physics interactions, making it great for effects like explosions, smoke, and liquids.

---

Slide 10: Particle System: Key Components

Content:
- Emitter
- Particles
- Modules (e.g., Emission, Shape, Color over Lifetime)

Speaker Notes:
The key components of a Particle System are the emitter, which controls where and how particles are spawned; the particles themselves; and various modules that control particle behavior over their lifetime, such as Emission, Shape, and Color over Lifetime.

---

Slide 11: Particle System: Emission Module

Content:
- Controls rate and timing of particle emission
- Options for bursts and continuous emission

Speaker Notes:
The Emission module is crucial as it controls how many particles are emitted and when. You can set up continuous emission for effects like smoke, or bursts for effects like explosions.

---

Slide 12: Particle System: Shape Module

Content:
- Defines the volume or surface from which particles are emitted
- Various shapes available (sphere, cone, box, etc.)

Speaker Notes:
The Shape module defines the area from which particles are emitted. This can be a point, a volume like a sphere or box, or even a mesh surface, allowing for diverse effect origins.

---

Slide 13: Particle System: Color over Lifetime

Content:
- Controls particle color changes over time
- Useful for effects like fire (red to yellow) or magic (color transitions)

Speaker Notes:
The Color over Lifetime module allows you to change particle colors as they age. This is particularly useful for effects like fire, where particles might transition from red to yellow, or magical effects with color shifts.

---

Slide 14: Particle System: Demo

Content:
- Live demonstration of creating a simple effect

Speaker Notes:
Let's create a simple effect using the Particle System to demonstrate these concepts. We'll make a magical sparkle effect that could be used for a spell or power-up.

Slide 15: Introduction to VFX Graph

Content:
- Node-based visual effects tool
- GPU-accelerated
- Capable of millions of particles
- Requires Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP)

Speaker Notes:
The VFX Graph is Unity's more advanced, node-based visual effects tool. It's GPU-accelerated, allowing for millions of particles, and offers more complex control over effects. Note that it requires using Unity's Scriptable Render Pipeline.
