To Patrick Dorman:

Hello Patrick,

I appreciate you reaching out regarding your situation. I understand the challenges you've faced, illness and technical issues really suck. However, more timely communication was crucial.

You've had several weeks of regular class and lab periods to work on this project and seek assistance; and office hours twice a week.

Focus on submitting your best work by the final due date. Consider adding UI for real-time interaction to your rock generator to partially meet the game-based interactivity. I can assist with specific issues, but can't extend deadlines.

While the circumstances are not ideal, your effort will be considered in the final evaluation.

Regards,
Darren

To Braden:

Braden,

Thank you for the update. I've noted your submissions for assignments 3 and 4. I'll review late submissions soon and update grades on BB Learn. Some credit will be given for missing assignments submitted by the final project due date, but not after.

I understand this quarter has been challenging, but regular attendance and earlier communication are crucial for success. Focus on completing your final project to the best of your ability by the due date.

Regards,
Darren
