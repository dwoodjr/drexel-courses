## Objective

Create a small, atmospheric/moody scene in Unity that demonstrates your understanding of lighting, post-processing, and camera effects. This assignment will allow you to apply the techniques learned in the Lighting and Post-Processing module to create a specific mood in a game environment.

## Requirements

1. Scene Creation:
    - Design a small, enclosed environment (e.g., a room, a forest clearing, or a street corner)
    - Include at least 3 different objects in your scene
2. Lighting:
    - Use a combination of at least 3 different light types (Example: Directional, Point, Spot)
    - Implement emissive material(s) if desired (Optional)
    - Use light probes for efficient lighting of dynamic objects (Optional)
    - Bake lighting for static objects (Optional)
3. Post-Processing:
    - Apply at least 2 post-processing effects that enhance your chosen mood
	    - Use the URP Global Volume to manage your post-processing stack
1. Camera Effects:
    - Implement camera zoom, shake effect, or real-time post-processing changes using ***C# scripting***
	    - Use Cinemachine if desired (Optional)
1. Mood:
    - Choose a specific mood for your scene, this can even be related to your final project (hint hint)
    - Ensure your lighting, post-processing, and camera work all contribute to this mood

## Submission Details
1. Your Unity project files, including all assets used ***(Only include the ASSETS, PACKAGES, and PROJECT SETTINGS folders)***
3. A brief written explanation (1/2 - 1 page) of your creative decisions and how they contribute to your chosen mood
4. A short video (1-2 minutes) showcasing your scene and its interactive elements

## Video Guidelines
> ðŸŽ¥ **Recording Tips:**
> - Capture both editor and play mode footage to show your setup and final result
> - Demonstrate all interactive elements and camera effects
> - Highlight the mood you've created through your lighting and post-processing choices
> - Keep it concise â€“ aim to fit everything within the 2-minute limit

## Evaluation
Your assignment will be evaluated based on:

- Effective use of lighting techniques to create the chosen mood
- Appropriate application of post-processing effects 
- Implementation of camera effects and movements 
- Overall aesthetic cohesion and mood conveyance

> ðŸ’¡ **Remember:** The goal is to create a cohesive atmosphere that effectively conveys your chosen mood. Pay attention to how all elements (lighting, post-processing, and camera work) work together to achieve this!
