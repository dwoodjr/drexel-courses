# Final - Project Progress Report - Shader Development Module

## Objective
Provide an update on your progress for the Shader and Material Development component of your final project. This assignment will help you reflect on your development so far and identify any challenges you're facing in creating custom shaders and materials for your game artifact.

## Requirements
1. Create a short video presentation (maximum 5 minutes) that covers:
   - A brief recap of your final project concept
   - Your progress on the Shader and Material Development module, including:
      - What shaders and materials you've created so far
      - How you're implementing these in your game artifact
      - Any interesting shader techniques or effects you've developed
   - Demonstration of your current work-in-progress, showing the shaders in action
   - Any questions or development roadblocks you're experiencing with shader creation

2. Submit a short written summary (200-300 words) of your progress, challenges, and questions related to shader and material development

## Video Guidelines
> ðŸŽ¥ **Recording Tips:**
> - Use screen recording software to capture your Unity editor, Shader Graph (if used), and play mode
> - Narrate your video to explain the shaders and materials you've created
> - Show before and after comparisons to highlight the impact of your custom shaders
> - Keep it concise â€“ aim to fit within the 5-minute limit

## Submission Details
- Video file (MP4 or MOV format preferred) or link to video (e.g., unlisted YouTube link)
- Written summary in PDF/DOCX/TXT format

## Evaluation
This progress report contributes to your final project grade. It will be evaluated based on:
- Clarity of presentation
- Demonstration of progress in Shader and Material Development
- Adherence to submission requirements

> ðŸ’¡ **Remember:** This is not just about showing finished work. Be honest about your shader development challenges â€“ it's an opportunity to get help and guidance on advanced shader techniques!
