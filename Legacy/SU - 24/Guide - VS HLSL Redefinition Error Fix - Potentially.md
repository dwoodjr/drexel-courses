# Potential Solutions for HLSL Redefinition Errors in Visual Studio

Some students, primarily using Visual Studio, are encountering HLSL errors related to "redefinition" of variables or method names. This document provides potential solutions to fix this persistent error.

> [!attention] 
> This error seems to primarily affect Visual Studio users (unclear if it's VS 2019 or 2022 specifically). If you're using a different IDE (e.g., JetBrains Rider), you may not encounter this issue and can disregard.

## Primary Solutions

1. **Update Visual Studio Code Unity Package**
   - Open the Package Manager in Unity
   - Look for the Visual Studio Code package and update if available

2. **Install HLSL Tools for Visual Studio**
   - Visit: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TimGJones.HLSLToolsforVisualStudio
   - Download and install the extension

3. **Update Include Statement**
   - Change or add the following include statement:
     ```hlsl
     #include "Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal/ShaderLibrary/Core.hlsl"
     ```

4. **Update Shader Program Tags**
   - Replace `CGPROGRAM` with `HLSLPROGRAM`
   - Replace `ENDCG` with `ENDHLSL`

5. **Rename Affected Variables or Methods**
   - If specific variables or methods are causing conflicts, try renaming them

## Alternative Solutions (If All Else Fails)

1. **Switch to a Different IDE**
   - Consider using JetBrains Rider, a Unity and Game Dev-friendly IDE (or some other Unity supported IDE)
      - ‚ùó***JetBrains Rider*** is my personal recommendation for Unity and Unreal IDE
   - Student license available at: https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/leaflets-gdc/students/

7. **Use Shader Graph**
   - Follow the `Shader Graph` version of the lab to complete the it using Shader Graph instead of HLSL
