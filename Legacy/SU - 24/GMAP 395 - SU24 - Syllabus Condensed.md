## Course Materials
- Students are required to use the Unity 3D engine. Unity is also available for free [https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
- Student work should be done using **_Unity 2022.3.9LTS_** as it is the latest stable version available in the labs.
- Students are required to post a downloadable zipped file of a Windows/PC, that is also acceptable.
- It is recommended that students use a dedicated storage device or cloud storage solution for development of class tutorials and assignments.
- No textbook is required. The instructor may supply topical suggested texts for reading online.

## Course Description 
This course will step through the various modules of game engine production, enabling students to gain access to real-time shaders and materials, particle systems, animation and modeling techniques, and game audio. 

## Course Purpose 
This course presents game artist capabilities, interactivity, and production workflows in 3D environments through the following topics: 
- Procedural + Modular Modeling and Workflows
- Material + Shader Development 
- Image + Particle Effects 
- Lighting + Camera Effects 
- Game Audio and Implementation 
These methods are taught to show how designers and artists can approach look development and implementation with an overview of technical tools and effects at artists’ fingertips to bring life to interactive 3D rendered scenes. 

## Expected Learning Outcomes 
By the end of the course, the students will be able to demonstrate skill in 
- Project Planning
- Art Direction 
- Scene + Object Lighting
- VFX
- Efficient Modeling Processes
- Game Audio and Spatialization

## Assignments 
Combining conceptual information provided in class and technical skills provided by the tutorial(s), students will complete bi-weekly assignments that test creative practices and knowledge gained from class and reading. The assignments are cumulative in nature and allow for the continued development of a single game artifact or prop using procedural/generative workflows and a modular design framework. Assignments will be completed individually and are based on assignment requirements and instructor discretion. 

### **Assignment 1 | Procedural Game Art** 
Summary: Students must conceptualize and develop a game artifact/prop for their final project and enhance it using procedural modeling and 3D design techniques. See the assignment details on Learn for more information.

### **Assignment 2 | Scripting Shaders and Materials**
Summary: Students will be tasked with creating two shaders to be used as part of their procedural game art developed in the first assignment. Shaders will be developed using Unity Shader Graph, with the optional use of a shader language, such as HLSL (if needed). See the assignment details on Learn for more information.

### **Assignment 3 | Particle and Camera Effects**
Summary: Students will make use of programmatically driven particle systems and camera effects to develop VFX for the final game artifact. Students will use C# scripting, Unity Post Processing, and VFX Graph to create interactivity between game assets and mechanics, camera, and particle effects. See the assignment details on Learn for more information.

### **Assignment 4 | Game Lighting and Shading** 
Summary: Students will create multiple variations (2-3) of the prototype final object and scene, using different lighting techniques, image effects, and camera manipulation. See the assignment details on Learn for more information.

### **Assignment 5 | Game Audio Implementation**
Summary: Students will implement a sound effect to communicate the visual effect(s) of their game artifact. They will also implement other sourced audio and music, spatializing sound sources when appropriate. See the assignment details on Learn for more information.
