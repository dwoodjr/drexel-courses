## Course Description
This course introduces fundamental scripting concepts through the exploration of modern scripting languages commonly used in disciplines related to digital content creation (DCC) pipelines. It serves as an introduction to technical art and technical pipeline direction aimed at complete beginners in undergraduate studies.

## Course Purpose
This class will introduce the fundamentals of scripting using relevant, object-oriented programming languages such as Python. Students will learn to write, execute, and debug programs in the context of enhancing the DCC pipeline. Topics covered will include various data types, operators, data arrays, conditional statements, loops, functions, and more. DCC-related examples will be reviewed in preparation for students creating their own tools. Starting with a simple task students will gradually increase tool complexity that automate repetitive processes in the DCC pipeline.

## Statement of Expected Learning
By the end of this course, students will be expected to:
- Understand and apply fundamental programming concepts such as data types, control flow, functions, etc.
- Develop scripts in Python or similar programming languages to automate repetitive tasks in DCC applications such as Maya, Houdini, Nuke, Unreal, Unity, etc.
- Gain proficiency in manipulating scene data via scripting.
- Analyze the programming interface for DCC applications and implement pipeline relevant tools.

### Academic Integrity
In digital media content creation, copying text, artwork, models, or animations without credit, whether copyrighted or made freely available on the web, is considered plagiarism and is forbidden.

### Use of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as large language models (e.g., ChatGPT or Claude), may be used in this course under specific guidelines:

1. AI tools are permitted for developing assets for assignments and projects, such as generating images or code snippets.
2. Students may use AI to help better contextualize and understand code, programming concepts, and course structures. This includes using AI for code review, breakdowns, and topic summaries.
3. All written materials, explanations, and analyses submitted for assignments should be the original work of the student. AI should not be used to generate these portions of your submissions.
4. The use of AI tools is not mandatory. Students may opt out of using AI assistants entirely if they prefer to complete all work without AI assistance.
5. When AI tools are used, students must clearly indicate which portions of their work were created with AI assistance and which tools were used.
6. Regardless of AI usage, students are responsible for understanding and being able to explain all aspects of their submitted work.

*Remember, the goal is to enhance your learning and creativity, not to replace your own critical thinking and problem-solving skills.* If you have any questions about appropriate use of AI tools for a specific assignment, please consult with the instructor or university policies and guidelines.

### Course Change Policy 
It is very important that each student has read and understood all the materials, assignments, and due dates on the syllabus.
