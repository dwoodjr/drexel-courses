## **Your Mission** 🎯

### **Part 1: Analyze Your Favorite Game or Interactive Narrative**

1. **Describe the Media**:  
    Write a short description of your favorite game or interactive narrative media. Explain why it stands out to you.
    - What are its key components (e.g., story, visuals, gameplay mechanics, music, interactivity)?
    - What makes it great and worthwhile in your opinion?
2. **Break It Down**:  
    Identify the individual “parts” or components of this media. List each element and consider how it contributes to the overall experience.

### **Part 2: Explore the Jobs Behind the Media**

1. **List the Jobs**:  
    For each component you identified, research and list the jobs/roles responsible for creating it.
    - For example, if the visuals stood out to you, list roles like concept artist, 3D modeler, texture artist, or technical artist.
2. **Research the Roles**:  
    For each role, answer the following:
    - What skills or tools are essential for success in this role?
    - What makes a person in this job successful (e.g., specific software knowledge, broader conceptual knowledge, creative problem-solving, technical expertise, communication skills)?

> **Note**: Don’t just focus on software or tools. Consider the "soft skills" and general knowledge needed for this role, such as problem-solving, teamwork, or understanding broader concepts like scripting, math, or color theory.

### **Part 3: Reflect on Your Path**

1. **Pick a Role**:  
    Choose one of the jobs or roles from your research that you’d like to pursue.
    - Why does this role appeal to you?
2. **Evaluate Your Skills**:  
    Reflect on the skills you already have that align with this role. Then, identify the skills or knowledge you need to acquire before graduating.
    - Be specific—what skillsets, tools, or techniques do you need to learn?
3. **Scripting Focus:  
    Include a section that directly connects your chosen role to scripting for Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools like Maya, Unity, or other software we covered in class. Specifically:
    - Explain how scripting (e.g., Python, MEL, C#) is or could be used in this role.
    - Discuss how learning to script can enhance workflows and improve collaboration in this field.
    - Identify specific scripting tasks or projects relevant to this role and reflect on how they align with your current skills and goals.

### **Part 4: Synthesize Your Insights**

In a final paragraph, connect your reflections to the broader lessons of this course.

- How will you use this understanding to approach learning opportunities in areas outside your current comfort zone?

### **Supporting Visuals and Media (Required)**

Your submission must include **images or supporting visuals** that illustrate and enhance your analysis. These can include:

- Screenshots of your chosen game/interactive media that highlight key components.
- Diagrams or flowcharts that explain the roles, processes, or scripting workflows you discuss.
- Annotated visuals that connect specific components to the roles and skills involved.

Visuals should be directly relevant to your analysis and integrated into your writeup or included as supplementary material in your submission folder. Be sure to reference them appropriately in your writeup to clarify their context and purpose.

### **Citations and References (Required)**

All external sources used for research, including articles, books, websites, or images, must be cited in **APA style**. Include a properly formatted references section at the end of your writeup.

- In-text citations should follow APA guidelines (e.g., Author, Year).

For guidance on APA citations, you can use [Purdue OWL's APA Formatting Guide](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/index.html) or other reliable resources. Proper citation is essential to maintain academic integrity.
