# Interactive Lab: Advanced Project Structure Automation

## Objective
Extend the basic project structure script to include more advanced features and customization options.

## Part 1: Code Review (10 minutes)
[Embed code from the workshop here]
- What does each function do?
- How could we make this script more flexible?

## Part 2: Adding Customization (20 minutes)
üé• [Video: Working with Command Line Arguments in Python]

Task: Modify the script to accept custom folder names as command-line arguments.
[Code snippet template]

## Part 3: Creating Config Files (20 minutes)
üìö [Reading: JSON Handling in Python]

Task: Create a JSON config file to store default project structures, and modify your script to read from this file.
[Code snippet template]

## Part 4: Error Handling Challenge (20 minutes)
üß© Challenge: Our script breaks if the directory already exists. Implement proper error handling to address this issue.
[Problematic code snippet]

## Reflection (10 minutes)
- How might this script be useful in a real production environment?
- What other features could make this tool more valuable for a tech artist?

## Bonus Task
üèÜ Implement a feature to create default files (e.g., README.md, .gitignore) in the project root.
