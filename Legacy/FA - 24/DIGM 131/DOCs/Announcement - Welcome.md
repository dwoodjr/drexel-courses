# Welcome to DIGM 131: Intro to Scripting for the Digital Content Creation Pipeline

Dear Students,

Welcome to DIGM 131! I'm excited to begin our journey into the world of scripting for digital content creation.

Before our first class, please complete the following:

1. Visit the `Week 0` page on our course BB Learn site. There, you'll find important information about the tools we'll be using throughout the course and instructions on how to access them.

2. Review the course syllabus located under the `Course Information` section. This document outlines our course objectives, expectations, and policies.

It's crucial that you complete the setup process outlined on the Week 0 page and familiarize yourself with the syllabus prior to our first session.

looking forward to meeting you all soon!

Best regards,
Darren
