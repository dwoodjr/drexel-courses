Hello All,

I wanted to reaffirm that seeing zeros in the gradebook is not a cause for alarm, at the moment. These zeros are placeholders to ensure an accurate calculation of the Weighted Total grade. While they may not remain zeros, addressing them will depend on you.

If you have missing assignments, zeros in the gradebook, or are unsatisfied with a grade for an assignment. You will have until **Sunday, December 15th @ 11:59 PM** to submit/re-submit work. This will be the final opportunity to get a grade or regrade for an assignment. Anything submitted past this final deadline will remain a zero in the gradebook and will count as such towards your final grade in the course. I will not guarantee full marks on these submissions but I will provide a fair grade.

*This deadline extension only extends to **Assignments**, NOT EXAMS.* 



Best,
Darren
