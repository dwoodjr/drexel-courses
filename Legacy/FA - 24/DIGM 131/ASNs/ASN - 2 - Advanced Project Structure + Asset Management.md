# Assignment 2: Advanced Project File Organizer

### Background
As a junior tech artist at Awesome Games Studio, you've impressed the team with your file sorting script from the lab. Now, the lead artist wants you to create a more advanced tool to help organize the studio's project files across multiple projects and asset types.

### Your Mission 🎯
Develop a Python script that can organize files from a source directory into a structured project hierarchy, categorizing files by project and asset category.

```txt
     DestinationDirectory/
     ├── ProjectA/
     │   ├── Textures/
     │   ├── Models/
     │   ├── Audio/
     │   └── Scripts/
     ├── ProjectB/
     │   ├── Textures/
     │   ├── Models/
     │   ├── Audio/
     │   └── Scripts/
     └── Misc/
```
### Guide

#### Setup
1. Create a new Python file named `project_organizer.py`.
2. Import the necessary modules (hint: you'll need `os` like in the lab).

#### File Type Detection
Modify the `get_file_type` function from the lab to include more specific categories:

```python
def get_file_type(filename):
    # Your code here
    # Consider categories like 'Textures', 'Models', 'Audio', 'Scripts'
    # Don't forget to handle unknown types!
```

> [!TIP]
> Look at the file extensions to determine the type. For example, '.fbx' or '.obj' might be 'Models'.

#### Project Detection
Create a new function to determine which project a file belongs to:

```python
def get_project(filename):
    # Your code here
    # Hint: Look for project identifiers in the filename
    # Return 'Misc' if you can't determine the project
```

> [!NOTE]
> You might assume that filenames start with a project identifier, like "ProjectA_asset.fbx".

#### File Organization
Create a function to organize a single file:

```python
def organize_file(source_path, dest_directory):
    filename = os.path.basename(source_path)
    project = get_project(filename)
    file_type = get_file_type(filename)
    
    # Your code here
    # 1. Construct the destination path
    # 2. Create necessary directories
    # 3. Move the file
    # 4. Handle naming conflicts
    # 5. Return information about the move for reporting
```

> [!WARNING]
> Remember to handle cases where the destination file might already exist!

#### Main Organization Function
Create the main function that will organize all files:

```python
def organize_project_files(source_directory, dest_directory):
    # Your code here
    # 1. Get all files from the source directory
    # 2. Organize each file
    # 3. Generate a report of the reorganization
```

#### User Input and Script Execution
Set up the main execution of your script:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Your code here
    # 1. Get source and destination directories from user input
    # 2. Call your organize_project_files function
    # 3. Print the final report
```

### Constraints and Considerations
- Use only the Python concepts and modules we've covered in class (e.g., os module, file operations).
- Your script should be able to handle files that don't fit into the predefined categories or projects.
- Consider how to make your script robust against errors (like permission issues or invalid paths).

### Deliverables 📦
1. Your Python script (`project_organizer.py`)
2. A README.md file explaining:
   - How to use your script
   - Your approach to determining file projects and categories
   - Any assumptions you made
   - Challenges you faced and how you overcame them
3. A sample generated by your script: *a screenshot of the reorganized files and directories.*

### Evaluation Criteria 🔍
- Effectiveness of the file organization logic
- Creativity in solving the project/category determination problem
- Code organization and readability
- Error handling and edge case consideration
- Quality and clarity of the README and generated report

### Submission 📤
Zip all deliverables into a folder titled `abc123_ASN#_ASNTitle` (replace `abc123` with your Drexel username) and submit via the course learning portal for Week 2.
	i.e.: `dkw34_2_AssetManagement.zip`

> This assignment builds on what you learned in the lab, taking it a step further. Don't be afraid to revisit the lab code for inspiration. Remember, problem-solving is key in tech art. Approach each function one at a time, test as you go, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you get stuck. You've got this! 💡🎮
